	/**
		Find all masked and/or non-finite points in a set of arguments,
		and return the arguments with only the unmasked points remaining.
		
		Arguments can be in any of 5 categories:
		
		1) 1-D masked arrays
		2) 1-D ndarrays
		3) ndarrays with more than one dimension
		4) other non-string iterables
		5) anything else
		
		The first argument must be in one of the first four categories;
		any argument with a length differing from that of the first
		argument (and hence anything in category 5) then will be
		passed through unchanged.
		
		Masks are obtained from all arguments of the correct length
		in categories 1, 2, and 4; a point is bad if masked in a masked
		array or if it is a nan or inf.  No attempt is made to
		extract a mask from categories 2, 3, and 4 if :meth:`np.isfinite`
		does not yield a Boolean array.
		
		All input arguments that are not passed unchanged are returned
		as ndarrays after removing the points or rows corresponding to
		masks in any of the arguments.
		
		A vastly simpler version of this function was originally
		written as a helper for Axes.scatter().
