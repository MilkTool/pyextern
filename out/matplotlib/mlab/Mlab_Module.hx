		Compute the angle of the frequency spectrum (wrapped phase spectrum) of
		*x*.  Data is padded to a length of *pad_to* and the windowing function
		*window* is applied to the signal.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : 1-D array or sequence
		    Array or sequence containing the data
		
		Fs : scalar
		    The sampling frequency (samples per time unit).  It is used
		    to calculate the Fourier frequencies, freqs, in cycles per time
		    unit. The default value is 2.
		
		window : callable or ndarray
		    A function or a vector of length *NFFT*. To create window

		    :func:`numpy.blackman`, :func:`numpy.hamming`,
		    :func:`numpy.bartlett`, :func:`scipy.signal`,
		    :func:`scipy.signal.get_window`, etc. The default is
		    :func:`window_hanning`.  If a function is passed as the
		    argument, it must take a data segment as an argument and

		sides : {'default', 'onesided', 'twosided'}
		    Specifies which sides of the spectrum to return.  Default gives the
		    default behavior, which returns one-sided for real data and both
		    for complex data.  'onesided' forces the return of a one-sided
		    spectrum, while 'twosided' forces two-sided.
		
		pad_to : int
		    The number of points to which the data segment is padded when
		    performing the FFT.  While not increasing the actual resolution of
		    the spectrum (the minimum distance between resolvable peaks),
		    this can give more points in the plot, allowing for more
		    detail. This corresponds to the *n* parameter in the call to fft().
		    The default is None, which sets *pad_to* equal to the length of the

		Parameters
		----------
		x, y
		    Array or sequence containing the data
		
		Fs : scalar
		    The sampling frequency (samples per time unit).  It is used
		    to calculate the Fourier frequencies, freqs, in cycles per time
		    unit. The default value is 2.
		
		window : callable or ndarray
		    A function or a vector of length *NFFT*. To create window

		    :func:`numpy.blackman`, :func:`numpy.hamming`,
		    :func:`numpy.bartlett`, :func:`scipy.signal`,

		    :func:`window_hanning`.  If a function is passed as the
		    argument, it must take a data segment as an argument and
		    return the windowed version of the segment.
		
		sides : {'default', 'onesided', 'twosided'}
		    Specifies which sides of the spectrum to return.  Default gives the
		    default behavior, which returns one-sided for real data and both
		    for complex data.  'onesided' forces the return of a one-sided
		    spectrum, while 'twosided' forces two-sided.
		
		pad_to : int
		    The number of points to which the data segment is padded when
		    performing the FFT.  This can be different from *NFFT*, which
		    specifies the number of data points used.  While not increasing
		    the actual resolution of the spectrum (the minimum distance between
		    resolvable peaks), this can give more points in the plot,
		    allowing for more detail. This corresponds to the *n* parameter
		    in the call to fft(). The default is None, which sets *pad_to*
		    equal to *NFFT*
		
		NFFT : int
		    The number of data points used in each block for the FFT.
		    A power 2 is most efficient.  The default value is 256.
		    This should *NOT* be used to get zero padding, or the scaling of the
		    result will be incorrect. Use *pad_to* for this instead.
		
		detrend : {'default', 'constant', 'mean', 'linear', 'none'} or callable
		    The function applied to each segment before fft-ing,
		    designed to remove the mean or linear trend.  Unlike in
		    MATLAB, where the *detrend* parameter is a vector, in
		    matplotlib is it a function.  The :mod:`~matplotlib.mlab`
		    module defines :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_none`,
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_mean`, and
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_linear`, but you can use
		    a custom function as well.  You can also use a string to choose
		    one of the functions.  'default', 'constant', and 'mean' call
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_mean`.  'linear' calls
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_linear`.  'none' calls
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_none`.
		
		scale_by_freq : bool, optional
		    Specifies whether the resulting density values should be scaled
		    by the scaling frequency, which gives density in units of Hz^-1.
		    This allows for integration over the returned frequency values.
		    The default is True for MATLAB compatibility.
		
		noverlap : integer
		    The number of points of overlap between blocks.  The default value
		    is 0 (no overlap).
		
		Returns
		-------
		The return value is the tuple (*Cxy*, *f*), where *f* are the
		frequencies of the coherence vector. For cohere, scaling the
		individual densities by the sampling frequency has no effect,
		since the factors cancel out.

	/**
		.. deprecated:: 2.2
		    scipy.signal.coherence
		
		Compute the coherence and phase for all pairs *ij*, in *X*.
		
		*X* is a *numSamples* * *numCols* array
		
		*ij* is a list of tuples.  Each tuple is a pair of indexes into
		the columns of X for which you want to compute coherence.  For
		example, if *X* has 64 columns, and you want to compute all
		nonredundant pairs, define *ij* as::
		
		  ij = []
		  for i in range(64):
		      for j in range(i+1,64):
		          ij.append( (i,j) )
		
		*preferSpeedOverMemory* is an optional bool. Defaults to true. If
		False, limits the caching by only making one, rather than two,
		complex cache arrays. This is useful if memory becomes critical.
		Even when *preferSpeedOverMemory* is False, :func:`cohere_pairs`
		will still give significant performance gains over calling
		:func:`cohere` for each pair, and will use subtantially less
		memory than if *preferSpeedOverMemory* is True.  In my tests with
		a 43000,64 array over all nonredundant pairs,
		*preferSpeedOverMemory* = True delivered a 33% performance boost
		on a 1.7GHZ Athlon with 512MB RAM compared with
		*preferSpeedOverMemory* = False.  But both solutions were more
		than 10x faster than naively crunching all possible pairs through
		:func:`cohere`.
		
		Returns
		-------
		Cxy : dictionary of (*i*, *j*) tuples -> coherence vector for
		    that pair.  i.e., ``Cxy[(i,j) = cohere(X[:,i], X[:,j])``.
		    Number of dictionary keys is ``len(ij)``.
		
		Phase : dictionary of phases of the cross spectral density at
		    each frequency for each pair.  Keys are (*i*, *j*).
		
		freqs : vector of frequencies, equal in length to either the
		     coherence or phase vectors for any (*i*, *j*) key.
		
		e.g., to make a coherence Bode plot::
		
		      subplot(211)
		      plot( freqs, Cxy[(12,19)])
		      subplot(212)
		      plot( freqs, Phase[(12,19)])
		
		For a large number of pairs, :func:`cohere_pairs` can be much more
		efficient than just calling :func:`cohere` for each pair, because
		it caches most of the intensive computations.  If :math:`N` is the
		number of pairs, this function is :math:`O(N)` for most of the
		heavy lifting, whereas calling cohere for each pair is
		:math:`O(N^2)`.  However, because of the caching, it is also more
		memory intensive, making 2 additional complex arrays with
		approximately the same number of elements as *X*.
		
		See :file:`test/cohere_pairs_test.py` in the src tree for an
		example script that shows that this :func:`cohere_pairs` and
		:func:`cohere` give the same results for a given pair.

		use. The usual behavior of :func:`range` can be obtained by
		setting the keyword *closed* = 0, in this case, :func:`frange`
		basically becomes :func:numpy.arange`.
		
		When *step* is given, it specifies the increment (or

		        window=mlab.window_hanning, noverlap=0, pad_to=None,
		        sides='default', scale_by_freq=None)
		
		The power spectral density :math:`P_{xx}` by Welch's average
		periodogram method.  The vector *x* is divided into *NFFT* length
		segments.  Each segment is detrended by function *detrend* and
		windowed by function *window*.  *noverlap* gives the length of
		the overlap between segments.  The :math:`|\mathrm{fft}(i)|^2`
		of each segment :math:`i` are averaged to compute :math:`P_{xx}`.
		
		If len(*x*) < *NFFT*, it will be zero padded to *NFFT*.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : 1-D array or sequence
		    Array or sequence containing the data
		
		Fs : scalar
		    The sampling frequency (samples per time unit).  It is used
		    to calculate the Fourier frequencies, freqs, in cycles per time
		    unit. The default value is 2.
		
		window : callable or ndarray
		    A function or a vector of length *NFFT*. To create window
		    vectors see :func:`window_hanning`, :func:`window_none`,
		    :func:`numpy.blackman`, :func:`numpy.hamming`,
		    :func:`numpy.bartlett`, :func:`scipy.signal`,
		    :func:`scipy.signal.get_window`, etc. The default is
		    :func:`window_hanning`.  If a function is passed as the
		    argument, it must take a data segment as an argument and
		    return the windowed version of the segment.
		
		sides : {'default', 'onesided', 'twosided'}
		    Specifies which sides of the spectrum to return.  Default gives the
		    default behavior, which returns one-sided for real data and both
		    for complex data.  'onesided' forces the return of a one-sided
		    spectrum, while 'twosided' forces two-sided.
		
		pad_to : int
		    The number of points to which the data segment is padded when
		    performing the FFT.  This can be different from *NFFT*, which
		    specifies the number of data points used.  While not increasing
		    the actual resolution of the spectrum (the minimum distance between
		    resolvable peaks), this can give more points in the plot,
		    allowing for more detail. This corresponds to the *n* parameter
		    in the call to fft(). The default is None, which sets *pad_to*
		    equal to *NFFT*
		
		NFFT : int
		    The number of data points used in each block for the FFT.
		    A power 2 is most efficient.  The default value is 256.
		    This should *NOT* be used to get zero padding, or the scaling of the
		    result will be incorrect. Use *pad_to* for this instead.
		
		detrend : {'default', 'constant', 'mean', 'linear', 'none'} or callable
		    The function applied to each segment before fft-ing,
		    designed to remove the mean or linear trend.  Unlike in
		    MATLAB, where the *detrend* parameter is a vector, in
		    matplotlib is it a function.  The :mod:`~matplotlib.mlab`
		    module defines :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_none`,
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_mean`, and
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_linear`, but you can use
		    a custom function as well.  You can also use a string to choose
		    one of the functions.  'default', 'constant', and 'mean' call
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_mean`.  'linear' calls
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_linear`.  'none' calls
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_none`.
		
		scale_by_freq : bool, optional
		    Specifies whether the resulting density values should be scaled
		    by the scaling frequency, which gives density in units of Hz^-1.
		    This allows for integration over the returned frequency values.
		    The default is True for MATLAB compatibility.
		
		noverlap : integer
		    The number of points of overlap between segments.
		    The default value is 0 (no overlap).
		
		Returns
		-------
		Pxx : 1-D array
		    The values for the power spectrum `P_{xx}` (real valued)
		
		freqs : 1-D array
		    The frequencies corresponding to the elements in *Pxx*

		Compute a spectrogram.
		
		Compute and plot a spectrogram of data in x.  Data are split into
		NFFT length segments and the spectrum of each section is
		computed.  The windowing function window is applied to each
		segment, and the amount of overlap of each segment is
		specified with noverlap.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    1-D array or sequence.
		
		Fs : scalar
		    The sampling frequency (samples per time unit).  It is used
		    to calculate the Fourier frequencies, freqs, in cycles per time
		    unit. The default value is 2.
		
		window : callable or ndarray
		    A function or a vector of length *NFFT*. To create window
		    vectors see :func:`window_hanning`, :func:`window_none`,
		    :func:`numpy.blackman`, :func:`numpy.hamming`,
		    :func:`numpy.bartlett`, :func:`scipy.signal`,
		    :func:`scipy.signal.get_window`, etc. The default is
		    :func:`window_hanning`.  If a function is passed as the
		    argument, it must take a data segment as an argument and
		    return the windowed version of the segment.
		
		sides : {'default', 'onesided', 'twosided'}
		    Specifies which sides of the spectrum to return.  Default gives the
		    default behavior, which returns one-sided for real data and both
		    for complex data.  'onesided' forces the return of a one-sided
		    spectrum, while 'twosided' forces two-sided.
		
		pad_to : int
		    The number of points to which the data segment is padded when
		    performing the FFT.  This can be different from *NFFT*, which
		    specifies the number of data points used.  While not increasing
		    the actual resolution of the spectrum (the minimum distance between
		    resolvable peaks), this can give more points in the plot,
		    allowing for more detail. This corresponds to the *n* parameter
		    in the call to fft(). The default is None, which sets *pad_to*
		    equal to *NFFT*
		
		NFFT : int
		    The number of data points used in each block for the FFT.
		    A power 2 is most efficient.  The default value is 256.
		    This should *NOT* be used to get zero padding, or the scaling of the
		    result will be incorrect. Use *pad_to* for this instead.
		
		detrend : {'default', 'constant', 'mean', 'linear', 'none'} or callable
		    The function applied to each segment before fft-ing,
		    designed to remove the mean or linear trend.  Unlike in
		    MATLAB, where the *detrend* parameter is a vector, in
		    matplotlib is it a function.  The :mod:`~matplotlib.mlab`
		    module defines :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_none`,
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_mean`, and
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_linear`, but you can use
		    a custom function as well.  You can also use a string to choose
		    one of the functions.  'default', 'constant', and 'mean' call
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_mean`.  'linear' calls
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_linear`.  'none' calls
		    :func:`~matplotlib.mlab.detrend_none`.
		
		scale_by_freq : bool, optional
		    Specifies whether the resulting density values should be scaled
		    by the scaling frequency, which gives density in units of Hz^-1.
		    This allows for integration over the returned frequency values.
		    The default is True for MATLAB compatibility.
		
		noverlap : int, optional
		    The number of points of overlap between blocks.  The default
		    value is 128.
		mode : str, optional
		    What sort of spectrum to use, default is 'psd'.
		        'psd'
		            Returns the power spectral density.
		
		        'complex'
		            Returns the complex-valued frequency spectrum.
		
		        'magnitude'
		            Returns the magnitude spectrum.
		
		        'angle'
		            Returns the phase spectrum without unwrapping.
		
		        'phase'
		            Returns the phase spectrum with unwrapping.
		
		Returns
		-------
		spectrum : array_like
		    2-D array, columns are the periodograms of successive segments.
		
		freqs : array_like
		    1-D array, frequencies corresponding to the rows in *spectrum*.
		
		t : array_like
		    1-D array, the times corresponding to midpoints of segments
		    (i.e the columns in *spectrum*).
		
		See Also
		--------
		psd : differs in the overlap and in the return values.
		complex_spectrum : similar, but with complex valued frequencies.

		phase_spectrum : similar to single segment when mode is 'phase'.
		
		Notes
		-----
		detrend and scale_by_freq only apply when *mode* is set to 'psd'.

		  not an academic journal but once in a while something serious
		  and original comes in adding that this was
		  "apparently a real solution" to a well known problem.
		
		For *yp* = *None*, the routine automatically determines the slopes
		using the :func:`slopes` routine.
		
		*x* is assumed to be sorted in increasing order.
		
		For values ``xi[j] < x[0]`` or ``xi[j] > x[-1]``, the routine
		tries an extrapolation.  The relevance of the data obtained from
		this, of course, is questionable...
