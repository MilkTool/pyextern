	/**
		Given a list of values (possibly containing numbers), returns a list where each
		value is broadcasted based on the following rules:
		  - `torch.*Tensor` instances are broadcasted as per the `broadcasting rules
		    <http://pytorch.org/docs/master/notes/broadcasting.html>`_
		  - numbers.Number instances (scalars) are upcast to tensors having
		    the same size and type as the first tensor passed to `values`.  If all the
		    values are scalars, then they are upcasted to Tensors having size
		    `(1,)`.
		
		Args:
		    values (list of `numbers.Number` or `torch.*Tensor`)
		
		Raises:
		    ValueError: if any of the values is not a `numbers.Number` or
		        `torch.*Tensor` instance
