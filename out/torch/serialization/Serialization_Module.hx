	/**
		Loads an object saved with :func:`torch.save` from a file.
		
		:meth:`torch.load` uses Python's unpickling facilities but treats storages,
		which underlie tensors, specially. They are first deserialized on the
		CPU and are then moved to the device they were saved from. If this fails
		(e.g. because the run time system doesn't have certain devices), an exception
		is raised. However, storages can be dynamically remapped to an alternative
		set of devices using the `map_location` argument.
		
		If `map_location` is a callable, it will be called once for each serialized
		storage with two arguments: storage and location. The storage argument
		will be the initial deserialization of the storage, residing on the CPU.
		Each serialized storage has a location tag associated with it which
		identifies the device it was saved from, and this tag is the second
		argument passed to map_location. The builtin location tags are `'cpu'` for
		CPU tensors and `'cuda:device_id'` (e.g. `'cuda:2'`) for CUDA tensors.
		`map_location` should return either None or a storage. If `map_location` returns
		a storage, it will be used as the final deserialized object, already moved to
		the right device. Otherwise, :math:`torch.load` will fall back to the default
		behavior, as if `map_location` wasn't specified.
		
		If `map_location` is a string, it should be a device tag, where all tensors
		should be loaded.
		
		Otherwise, if `map_location` is a dict, it will be used to remap location tags
		appearing in the file (keys), to ones that specify where to put the
		storages (values).
		
		User extensions can register their own location tags and tagging and
		deserialization methods using `register_package`.
		
		Args:
		    f: a file-like object (has to implement read, readline, tell, and seek),
		        or a string containing a file name
		    map_location: a function, torch.device, string or a dict specifying how to remap storage
		        locations
		    pickle_module: module used for unpickling metadata and objects (has to
		        match the pickle_module used to serialize file)
		
		.. note::
		    When you call :meth:`torch.load()` on a file which contains GPU tensors, those tensors
		    will be loaded to GPU by default. You can call `torch.load(.., map_location='cpu')`
		    and then :meth:`load_state_dict` to avoid GPU RAM surge when loading a model checkpoint.
		
		Example:
		    >>> torch.load('tensors.pt')
		    # Load all tensors onto the CPU
		    >>> torch.load('tensors.pt', map_location=torch.device('cpu'))
		    # Load all tensors onto the CPU, using a function
		    >>> torch.load('tensors.pt', map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage)
		    # Load all tensors onto GPU 1
		    >>> torch.load('tensors.pt', map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage.cuda(1))
		    # Map tensors from GPU 1 to GPU 0
		    >>> torch.load('tensors.pt', map_location={'cuda:1':'cuda:0'})
		    # Load tensor from io.BytesIO object
		    >>> with open('tensor.pt') as f:
		            buffer = io.BytesIO(f.read())
		    >>> torch.load(buffer)

		Saves an object to a disk file.
		
		See also: :ref:`recommend-saving-models`
		
		Args:
		    obj: saved object
		    f: a file-like object (has to implement write and flush) or a string
		       containing a file name
		    pickle_module: module used for pickling metadata and objects

		.. warning::
		    If you are using Python 2, torch.save does NOT support StringIO.StringIO
		    as a valid file-like object. This is because the write method should return
		    the number of bytes written; StringIO.write() does not do this.
		
		    Please use something like io.BytesIO instead.
		
		Example:
		    >>> # Save to file
		    >>> x = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
		    >>> torch.save(x, 'tensor.pt')
		    >>> # Save to io.BytesIO buffer
