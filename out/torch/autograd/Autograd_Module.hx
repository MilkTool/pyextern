		Computes the sum of gradients of given tensors w.r.t. graph leaves.
		
		The graph is differentiated using the chain rule. If any of ``tensors``
		are non-scalar (i.e. their data has more than one element) and require
		gradient, the function additionally requires specifying ``grad_tensors``.
		It should be a sequence of matching length, that contains gradient of
		the differentiated function w.r.t. corresponding tensors (``None`` is an
		acceptable value for all tensors that don't need gradient tensors).
		
		This function accumulates gradients in the leaves - you might need to zero
		them before calling it.
		
		Arguments:
		    tensors (sequence of Tensor): Tensors of which the derivative will be
		        computed.
		    grad_tensors (sequence of (Tensor or None)): Gradients w.r.t.
		        each element of corresponding tensors. None values can be specified for
		        scalar Tensors or ones that don't require grad. If a None value would
		        be acceptable for all grad_tensors, then this argument is optional.
		    retain_graph (bool, optional): If ``False``, the graph used to compute the grad
		        will be freed. Note that in nearly all cases setting this option to ``True``
		        is not needed and often can be worked around in a much more efficient
		        way. Defaults to the value of ``create_graph``.
		    create_graph (bool, optional): If ``True``, graph of the derivative will
		        be constructed, allowing to compute higher order derivative products.
		        Defaults to ``False``.

		Computes and returns the sum of gradients of outputs w.r.t. the inputs.
		
		``grad_outputs`` should be a sequence of length matching ``output``
		containing the pre-computed gradients w.r.t. each of the outputs. If an
		output doesn't require_grad, then the gradient can be ``None``).
		
		If ``only_inputs`` is ``True``, the function will only return a list of gradients
		w.r.t the specified inputs. If it's ``False``, then gradient w.r.t. all remaining
		leaves will still be computed, and will be accumulated into their ``.grad``
		attribute.
		
		Arguments:
		    outputs (sequence of Tensor): outputs of the differentiated function.
		    inputs (sequence of Tensor): Inputs w.r.t. which the gradient will be
		        returned (and not accumulated into ``.grad``).
		    grad_outputs (sequence of Tensor): Gradients w.r.t. each output.
		        None values can be specified for scalar Tensors or ones that don't require
		        grad. If a None value would be acceptable for all grad_tensors, then this
		        argument is optional. Default: None.
		    retain_graph (bool, optional): If ``False``, the graph used to compute the grad

		    create_graph (bool, optional): If ``True``, graph of the derivative will
		        be constructed, allowing to compute higher order derivative products.
		        Default: ``False``.
		    allow_unused (bool, optional): If ``False``, specifying inputs that were not
		        used when computing outputs (and therefore their grad is always zero)
		        is an error. Defaults to ``False``.

		Check gradients computed via small finite differences against analytical
		gradients w.r.t. tensors in :attr:`inputs` that are of floating point type
		and with ``requires_grad=True``.
		
		The check between numerical and analytical gradients uses :func:`~torch.allclose`.
		
		.. note::
		    The default values are designed for :attr:`input` of double precision.
		    This check will likely fail if :attr:`input` is of less precision, e.g.,

		.. warning::
		   If any checked tensor in :attr:`input` has overlapping memory, i.e.,
		   different indices pointing to the same memory address (e.g., from
		   :func:`torch.expand`), this check will likely fail because the numerical
		   gradients computed by point perturbation at such indices will change
		   values at all other indices that share the same memory address.
		
		Args:
		    func (function): a Python function that takes Tensor inputs and returns
		        a Tensor or a tuple of Tensors
		    inputs (tuple of Tensor or Tensor): inputs to the function
		    eps (float, optional): perturbation for finite differences
		    atol (float, optional): absolute tolerance
