	/**
		array(object, dtype=None, copy=True, order='K', subok=False, ndmin=0)
		
		Create an array.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		object : array_like
		    An array, any object exposing the array interface, an object whose
		    __array__ method returns an array, or any (nested) sequence.
		dtype : data-type, optional
		    The desired data-type for the array.  If not given, then the type will
		    be determined as the minimum type required to hold the objects in the
		    sequence.  This argument can only be used to 'upcast' the array.  For
		    downcasting, use the .astype(t) method.
		copy : bool, optional
		    If true (default), then the object is copied.  Otherwise, a copy will
		    only be made if __array__ returns a copy, if obj is a nested sequence,
		    or if a copy is needed to satisfy any of the other requirements
		    (`dtype`, `order`, etc.).
		order : {'K', 'A', 'C', 'F'}, optional
		    Specify the memory layout of the array. If object is not an array, the
		    newly created array will be in C order (row major) unless 'F' is
		    specified, in which case it will be in Fortran order (column major).
		    If object is an array the following holds.
		
		    ===== ========= ===================================================
		    order  no copy                     copy=True
		    ===== ========= ===================================================
		    'K'   unchanged F & C order preserved, otherwise most similar order
		    'A'   unchanged F order if input is F and not C, otherwise C order
		    'C'   C order   C order
		    'F'   F order   F order
		    ===== ========= ===================================================
		
		    When ``copy=False`` and a copy is made for other reasons, the result is
		    the same as if ``copy=True``, with some exceptions for `A`, see the
		    Notes section. The default order is 'K'.
		subok : bool, optional
		    If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise
		    the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array (default).
		ndmin : int, optional
		    Specifies the minimum number of dimensions that the resulting
		    array should have.  Ones will be pre-pended to the shape as
		    needed to meet this requirement.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray
		    An array object satisfying the specified requirements.
		
		See Also
		--------
		empty_like : Return an empty array with shape and type of input.
		ones_like : Return an array of ones with shape and type of input.
		zeros_like : Return an array of zeros with shape and type of input.
		full_like : Return a new array with shape of input filled with value.
		empty : Return a new uninitialized array.
		ones : Return a new array setting values to one.
		zeros : Return a new array setting values to zero.
		full : Return a new array of given shape filled with value.
		
		
		Notes
		-----
		When order is 'A' and `object` is an array in neither 'C' nor 'F' order,
		and a copy is forced by a change in dtype, then the order of the result is
		not necessarily 'C' as expected. This is likely a bug.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> np.array([1, 2, 3])
		array([1, 2, 3])
		
		Upcasting:
		
		>>> np.array([1, 2, 3.0])
		array([ 1.,  2.,  3.])
		
		More than one dimension:
		
		>>> np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
		array([[1, 2],
		       [3, 4]])
		
		Minimum dimensions 2:
		
		>>> np.array([1, 2, 3], ndmin=2)
		array([[1, 2, 3]])
		
		Type provided:
		
		>>> np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=complex)
		array([ 1.+0.j,  2.+0.j,  3.+0.j])
		
		Data-type consisting of more than one element:
		
		>>> x = np.array([(1,2),(3,4)],dtype=[('a','<i4'),('b','<i4')])
		>>> x['a']
		array([1, 3])
		
		Creating an array from sub-classes:
		
		>>> np.array(np.mat('1 2; 3 4'))
		array([[1, 2],
		       [3, 4]])
		
		>>> np.array(np.mat('1 2; 3 4'), subok=True)
		matrix([[1, 2],
		        [3, 4]])

		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input array, can be complex.
		n : int, optional
		    Length of the transformed axis of the output.
		    If `n` is smaller than the length of the input, the input is cropped.
		    If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.  If `n` is not given,

		Notes
		-----
		FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) refers to a way the discrete Fourier
		Transform (DFT) can be calculated efficiently, by using symmetries in the
		calculated terms.  The symmetry is highest when `n` is a power of 2, and
		the transform is therefore most efficient for these sizes.
		
		The DFT is defined, with the conventions used in this implementation, in
		the documentation for the `numpy.fft` module.

		Compute the 2-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform
		
		This function computes the *n*-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform
		over any axes in an *M*-dimensional array by means of the
		Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  By default, the transform is computed over
		the last two axes of the input array, i.e., a 2-dimensional FFT.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input array, can be complex
		s : sequence of ints, optional
		    Shape (length of each transformed axis) of the output
		    (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0, ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.).
		    This corresponds to ``n`` for ``fft(x, n)``.
		    Along each axis, if the given shape is smaller than that of the input,
		    the input is cropped.  If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.
		    if `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the axes specified
		    by `axes` is used.
		axes : sequence of ints, optional
		    Axes over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last two
		    axes are used.  A repeated index in `axes` means the transform over
		    that axis is performed multiple times.  A one-element sequence means
		    that a one-dimensional FFT is performed.
		norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
		    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0
		
		    Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.
		
		Returns
		-------

		Raises
		------
		ValueError
		    If `s` and `axes` have different length, or `axes` not given and
		    ``len(s) != 2``.
		IndexError
		    If an element of `axes` is larger than than the number of axes of `a`.

		Notes

		`fft2` is just `fftn` with a different default for `axes`.
		
		The output, analogously to `fft`, contains the term for zero frequency in

		Compute the one-dimensional inverse discrete Fourier Transform.
		
		This function computes the inverse of the one-dimensional *n*-point
		discrete Fourier transform computed by `fft`.  In other words,
		``ifft(fft(a)) == a`` to within numerical accuracy.
		For a general description of the algorithm and definitions,
		see `numpy.fft`.
		
		The input should be ordered in the same way as is returned by `fft`,
		i.e.,
		
		* ``a[0]`` should contain the zero frequency term,
		* ``a[1:n//2]`` should contain the positive-frequency terms,
		* ``a[n//2 + 1:]`` should contain the negative-frequency terms, in
		  increasing order starting from the most negative frequency.
		
		For an even number of input points, ``A[n//2]`` represents the sum of
		the values at the positive and negative Nyquist frequencies, as the two
		are aliased together. See `numpy.fft` for details.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input array, can be complex.
		n : int, optional
		    Length of the transformed axis of the output.
		    If `n` is smaller than the length of the input, the input is cropped.
		    If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.  If `n` is not given,
		    the length of the input along the axis specified by `axis` is used.
		    See notes about padding issues.
		axis : int, optional
		    Axis over which to compute the inverse DFT.  If not given, the last
		    axis is used.
		norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
		    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0
		
		    Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : complex ndarray
		    The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
		    indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.
		
		Raises
		------
		IndexError
		    If `axes` is larger than the last axis of `a`.

		fft : The one-dimensional (forward) FFT, of which `ifft` is the inverse
		ifft2 : The two-dimensional inverse FFT.

		Notes
		-----
		If the input parameter `n` is larger than the size of the input, the input
		is padded by appending zeros at the end.  Even though this is the common
		approach, it might lead to surprising results.  If a different padding is
		desired, it must be performed before calling `ifft`.

		Returns the real valued `n`-point inverse discrete Fourier transform

		If you specify an `n` such that `a` must be zero-padded or truncated, the

		Hermitian-symmetric, i.e. the negative frequency terms are just the complex
		conjugates of the corresponding positive-frequency terms, and the
		negative-frequency terms are therefore redundant.  This function does not
		compute the negative frequency terms, and the length of the transformed
		axis of the output is therefore ``n//2 + 1``.
		
		When ``A = rfft(a)`` and fs is the sampling frequency, ``A[0]`` contains
		the zero-frequency term 0*fs, which is real due to Hermitian symmetry.
		
		If `n` is even, ``A[-1]`` contains the term representing both positive
		and negative Nyquist frequency (+fs/2 and -fs/2), and must also be purely
		real. If `n` is odd, there is no term at fs/2; ``A[-1]`` contains
		the largest positive frequency (fs/2*(n-1)/n), and is complex in the
		general case.
		
		If the input `a` contains an imaginary part, it is silently discarded.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> np.fft.fft([0, 1, 0, 0])
		array([ 1.+0.j,  0.-1.j, -1.+0.j,  0.+1.j])
		>>> np.fft.rfft([0, 1, 0, 0])
		array([ 1.+0.j,  0.-1.j, -1.+0.j])
		
		Notice how the final element of the `fft` output is the complex conjugate
		of the second element, for real input. For `rfft`, this symmetry is
		exploited to compute only the non-negative frequency terms.

	/**
		Compute the N-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform for real input.
		
		This function computes the N-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform over
		any number of axes in an M-dimensional real array by means of the Fast
		Fourier Transform (FFT).  By default, all axes are transformed, with the
		real transform performed over the last axis, while the remaining
		transforms are complex.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like
		    Input array, taken to be real.
		s : sequence of ints, optional
		    Shape (length along each transformed axis) to use from the input.
		    (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0, ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.).
		    The final element of `s` corresponds to `n` for ``rfft(x, n)``, while
		    for the remaining axes, it corresponds to `n` for ``fft(x, n)``.
		    Along any axis, if the given shape is smaller than that of the input,
		    the input is cropped.  If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.
		    if `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the axes specified
		    by `axes` is used.
		axes : sequence of ints, optional
		    Axes over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last ``len(s)``
		    axes are used, or all axes if `s` is also not specified.
		norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
		    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0
		
		    Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : complex ndarray
		    The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes
		    indicated by `axes`, or by a combination of `s` and `a`,
		    as explained in the parameters section above.
		    The length of the last axis transformed will be ``s[-1]//2+1``,
		    while the remaining transformed axes will have lengths according to
		    `s`, or unchanged from the input.
		
		Raises
		------
		ValueError
		    If `s` and `axes` have different length.
		IndexError
		    If an element of `axes` is larger than than the number of axes of `a`.

		fftn : The n-dimensional FFT.
		rfft2 : The two-dimensional FFT of real input.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The transform for real input is performed over the last transformation
		axis, as by `rfft`, then the transform over the remaining axes is
		performed as by `fftn`.  The order of the output is as for `rfft` for the
		final transformation axis, and as for `fftn` for the remaining

	/**
		Take elements from an array along an axis.
		
		When axis is not None, this function does the same thing as "fancy"
		indexing (indexing arrays using arrays); however, it can be easier to use
		if you need elements along a given axis. A call such as
		``np.take(arr, indices, axis=3)`` is equivalent to
		``arr[:,:,:,indices,...]``.
		
		Explained without fancy indexing, this is equivalent to the following use
		of `ndindex`, which sets each of ``ii``, ``jj``, and ``kk`` to a tuple of
		indices::
		
		    Ni, Nk = a.shape[:axis], a.shape[axis+1:]
		    Nj = indices.shape
		    for ii in ndindex(Ni):
		        for jj in ndindex(Nj):
		            for kk in ndindex(Nk):
		                out[ii + jj + kk] = a[ii + (indices[jj],) + kk]
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : array_like (Ni..., M, Nk...)
		    The source array.
		indices : array_like (Nj...)
		    The indices of the values to extract.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
		
		    Also allow scalars for indices.
		axis : int, optional
		    The axis over which to select values. By default, the flattened
		    input array is used.
		out : ndarray, optional (Ni..., Nj..., Nk...)
		    If provided, the result will be placed in this array. It should
		    be of the appropriate shape and dtype.
		mode : {'raise', 'wrap', 'clip'}, optional
		    Specifies how out-of-bounds indices will behave.
		
		    * 'raise' -- raise an error (default)
		    * 'wrap' -- wrap around
		    * 'clip' -- clip to the range
		
		    'clip' mode means that all indices that are too large are replaced
		    by the index that addresses the last element along that axis. Note
		    that this disables indexing with negative numbers.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray (Ni..., Nj..., Nk...)
		    The returned array has the same type as `a`.
		
		See Also
		--------
		compress : Take elements using a boolean mask
		ndarray.take : equivalent method
		take_along_axis : Take elements by matching the array and the index arrays
		
		Notes
		-----
		
		By eliminating the inner loop in the description above, and using `s_` to
		build simple slice objects, `take` can be expressed  in terms of applying
		fancy indexing to each 1-d slice::
		
		    Ni, Nk = a.shape[:axis], a.shape[axis+1:]
		    for ii in ndindex(Ni):
		        for kk in ndindex(Nj):
		            out[ii + s_[...,] + kk] = a[ii + s_[:,] + kk][indices]
		
		For this reason, it is equivalent to (but faster than) the following use
		of `apply_along_axis`::
		
		    out = np.apply_along_axis(lambda a_1d: a_1d[indices], axis, a)
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> a = [4, 3, 5, 7, 6, 8]
		>>> indices = [0, 1, 4]
		>>> np.take(a, indices)
		array([4, 3, 6])
		
		In this example if `a` is an ndarray, "fancy" indexing can be used.
		
		>>> a = np.array(a)
		>>> a[indices]
		array([4, 3, 6])
		
		If `indices` is not one dimensional, the output also has these dimensions.
		
		>>> np.take(a, [[0, 1], [2, 3]])
		array([[4, 3],
