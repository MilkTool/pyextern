		beta(a, b, size=None)
		
		Draw samples from a Beta distribution.
		
		The Beta distribution is a special case of the Dirichlet distribution,
		and is related to the Gamma distribution.  It has the probability
		distribution function
		
		.. math:: f(x; a,b) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)} x^{\alpha - 1}
		                                                 (1 - x)^{\beta - 1},
		
		where the normalisation, B, is the beta function,
		
		.. math:: B(\alpha, \beta) = \int_0^1 t^{\alpha - 1}
		                             (1 - t)^{\beta - 1} dt.
		
		It is often seen in Bayesian inference and order statistics.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : float or array_like of floats
		    Alpha, positive (>0).
		b : float or array_like of floats
		    Beta, positive (>0).
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
		    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
		    a single value is returned if ``a`` and ``b`` are both scalars.
		    Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(a, b).size`` samples are drawn.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray or scalar
		    Drawn samples from the parameterized beta distribution.

		binomial(n, p, size=None)
		
		Draw samples from a binomial distribution.
		
		Samples are drawn from a binomial distribution with specified
		parameters, n trials and p probability of success where
		n an integer >= 0 and p is in the interval [0,1]. (n may be
		input as a float, but it is truncated to an integer in use)
		
		Parameters
		----------
		n : int or array_like of ints
		    Parameter of the distribution, >= 0. Floats are also accepted,
		    but they will be truncated to integers.
		p : float or array_like of floats
		    Parameter of the distribution, >= 0 and <=1.
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
		    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
		    a single value is returned if ``n`` and ``p`` are both scalars.
		    Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(n, p).size`` samples are drawn.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray or scalar
		    Drawn samples from the parameterized binomial distribution, where
		    each sample is equal to the number of successes over the n trials.
		
		See Also
		--------
		scipy.stats.binom : probability density function, distribution or
		    cumulative density function, etc.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The probability density for the binomial distribution is
		
		.. math:: P(N) = \binom{n}{N}p^N(1-p)^{n-N},
		
		where :math:`n` is the number of trials, :math:`p` is the probability
		of success, and :math:`N` is the number of successes.
		
		When estimating the standard error of a proportion in a population by
		using a random sample, the normal distribution works well unless the
		product p*n <=5, where p = population proportion estimate, and n =
		number of samples, in which case the binomial distribution is used
		instead. For example, a sample of 15 people shows 4 who are left
		handed, and 11 who are right handed. Then p = 4/15 = 27%. 0.27*15 = 4,
		so the binomial distribution should be used in this case.

		f(dfnum, dfden, size=None)
		
		Draw samples from an F distribution.
		
		Samples are drawn from an F distribution with specified parameters,

		zero.
		
		The random variate of the F distribution (also known as the

		Parameters
		----------

		    Degrees of freedom in numerator, should be > 0.
		dfden : float or array_like of float

		Notes
		-----
		The F statistic is used to compare in-group variances to between-group
		variances. Calculating the distribution depends on the sampling, and
		so it is a function of the respective degrees of freedom in the
		problem.  The variable `dfnum` is the number of samples minus one, the
		between-groups degrees of freedom, while `dfden` is the within-groups
		degrees of freedom, the sum of the number of samples in each group
		minus the number of groups.

		Examples
		--------
		An example from Glantz[1], pp 47-40:
		
		Two groups, children of diabetics (25 people) and children from people
		without diabetes (25 controls). Fasting blood glucose was measured,
		case group had a mean value of 86.1, controls had a mean value of
		82.2. Standard deviations were 2.09 and 2.49 respectively. Are these
		data consistent with the null hypothesis that the parents diabetic
		status does not affect their children's blood glucose levels?
		Calculating the F statistic from the data gives a value of 36.01.
		
		Draw samples from the distribution:
		
		>>> dfnum = 1. # between group degrees of freedom
		>>> dfden = 48. # within groups degrees of freedom
		>>> s = np.random.f(dfnum, dfden, 1000)
		
		The lower bound for the top 1% of the samples is :
		
		>>> sort(s)[-10]
		7.61988120985
		
		So there is about a 1% chance that the F statistic will exceed 7.62,
		the measured value is 36, so the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1%
		level.

		The Gumbel is a special case of the Extreme Value Type I distribution
		for maximums from distributions with "exponential-like" tails.
		
		The probability density for the Gumbel distribution is
		
		.. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{-(x - \mu)/ \beta}}{\beta} e^{ -e^{-(x - \mu)/
		          \beta}},
		
		where :math:`\mu` is the mode, a location parameter, and
		:math:`\beta` is the scale parameter.
		
		The Gumbel (named for German mathematician Emil Julius Gumbel) was used
		very early in the hydrology literature, for modeling the occurrence of
		flood events. It is also used for modeling maximum wind speed and
		rainfall rates.  It is a "fat-tailed" distribution - the probability of
		an event in the tail of the distribution is larger than if one used a
		Gaussian, hence the surprisingly frequent occurrence of 100-year
		floods. Floods were initially modeled as a Gaussian process, which
		underestimated the frequency of extreme events.
		
		It is one of a class of extreme value distributions, the Generalized
		Extreme Value (GEV) distributions, which also includes the Weibull and
		Frechet.
		
		The function has a mean of :math:`\mu + 0.57721\beta` and a variance
		of :math:`\frac{\pi^2}{6}\beta^2`.

		hypergeometric(ngood, nbad, nsample, size=None)
		
		Draw samples from a Hypergeometric distribution.
		
		Samples are drawn from a hypergeometric distribution with specified
		parameters, ngood (ways to make a good selection), nbad (ways to make
		a bad selection), and nsample = number of items sampled, which is less
		than or equal to the sum ngood + nbad.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		ngood : int or array_like of ints
		    Number of ways to make a good selection.  Must be nonnegative.
		nbad : int or array_like of ints
		    Number of ways to make a bad selection.  Must be nonnegative.
		nsample : int or array_like of ints
		    Number of items sampled.  Must be at least 1 and at most
		    ``ngood + nbad``.
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
		    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
		    a single value is returned if ``ngood``, ``nbad``, and ``nsample``
		    are all scalars.  Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(ngood, nbad, nsample).size``
		    samples are drawn.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray or scalar
		    Drawn samples from the parameterized hypergeometric distribution.
		
		See Also
		--------
		scipy.stats.hypergeom : probability density function, distribution or
		    cumulative density function, etc.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The probability density for the Hypergeometric distribution is
		
		.. math:: P(x) = \frac{\binom{g}{x}\binom{b}{n-x}}{\binom{g+b}{n}},
		
		where :math:`0 \le x \le n` and :math:`n-b \le x \le g`
		
		for P(x) the probability of x successes, g = ngood, b = nbad, and
		n = number of samples.
		
		Consider an urn with black and white marbles in it, ngood of them
		black and nbad are white. If you draw nsample balls without
		replacement, then the hypergeometric distribution describes the
		distribution of black balls in the drawn sample.
		
		Note that this distribution is very similar to the binomial
		distribution, except that in this case, samples are drawn without
		replacement, whereas in the Binomial case samples are drawn with
		replacement (or the sample space is infinite). As the sample space
		becomes large, this distribution approaches the binomial.

		laplace(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)
		
		Draw samples from the Laplace or double exponential distribution with

		The Laplace distribution is similar to the Gaussian/normal distribution,

		Parameters
		----------
		loc : float or array_like of floats, optional

		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray or scalar

		                               \exp\left(-\frac{|x - \mu|}{\lambda}\right).
		
		The first law of Laplace, from 1774, states that the frequency
		of an error can be expressed as an exponential function of the
		absolute magnitude of the error, which leads to the Laplace
		distribution. For many problems in economics and health
		sciences, this distribution seems to model the data better
		than the standard Gaussian distribution.

		multinomial(n, pvals, size=None)
		
		Draw samples from a multinomial distribution.
		
		The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalisation of the
		binomial distribution.  Take an experiment with one of ``p``
		possible outcomes.  An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice,
		where the outcome can be 1 through 6.  Each sample drawn from the
		distribution represents `n` such experiments.  Its values,
		``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_p]``, represent the number of times the
		outcome was ``i``.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		n : int
		    Number of experiments.
		pvals : sequence of floats, length p
		    Probabilities of each of the ``p`` different outcomes.  These
		    should sum to 1 (however, the last element is always assumed to
		    account for the remaining probability, as long as
		    ``sum(pvals[:-1]) <= 1)``.
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
		    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
		    single value is returned.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray
		    The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
		    the shape is ``(N,)``.
		
		    In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
		    value drawn from the distribution.
		
		Examples
		--------
		Throw a dice 20 times:
		
		>>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=1)
		array([[4, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1]])
		
		It landed 4 times on 1, once on 2, etc.
		
		Now, throw the dice 20 times, and 20 times again:
		
		>>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=2)
		array([[3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3],
		       [2, 4, 3, 4, 0, 7]])
		
		For the first run, we threw 3 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.  For the second,
		we threw 2 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.
		
		A loaded die is more likely to land on number 6:
		
		>>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1/7.]*5 + [2/7.])
		array([11, 16, 14, 17, 16, 26])
		
		The probability inputs should be normalized. As an implementation
		detail, the value of the last entry is ignored and assumed to take
		up any leftover probability mass, but this should not be relied on.
		A biased coin which has twice as much weight on one side as on the
		other should be sampled like so:
		
		>>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3])  # RIGHT
		array([38, 62])

		multivariate_normal(mean, cov[, size, check_valid, tol])
		
		Draw random samples from a multivariate normal distribution.
		
		The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a
		generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher
		dimensions.  Such a distribution is specified by its mean and
		covariance matrix.  These parameters are analogous to the mean
		(average or "center") and variance (standard deviation, or "width,"
		squared) of the one-dimensional normal distribution.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		mean : 1-D array_like, of length N
		    Mean of the N-dimensional distribution.
		cov : 2-D array_like, of shape (N, N)
		    Covariance matrix of the distribution. It must be symmetric and
		    positive-semidefinite for proper sampling.
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Given a shape of, for example, ``(m,n,k)``, ``m*n*k`` samples are
		    generated, and packed in an `m`-by-`n`-by-`k` arrangement.  Because
		    each sample is `N`-dimensional, the output shape is ``(m,n,k,N)``.
		    If no shape is specified, a single (`N`-D) sample is returned.
		check_valid : { 'warn', 'raise', 'ignore' }, optional
		    Behavior when the covariance matrix is not positive semidefinite.
		tol : float, optional
		    Tolerance when checking the singular values in covariance matrix.
		    cov is cast to double before the check.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray
		    The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
		    the shape is ``(N,)``.
		
		    In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
		    value drawn from the distribution.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The mean is a coordinate in N-dimensional space, which represents the
		location where samples are most likely to be generated.  This is
		analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or
		univariate normal distribution.
		
		Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
		From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional
		samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix
		element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.
		The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its
		"spread").
		
		Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular
		approximations include:
		
		  - Spherical covariance (`cov` is a multiple of the identity matrix)
		  - Diagonal covariance (`cov` has non-negative elements, and only on
		    the diagonal)
		
		This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting
		generated data-points:
		
		>>> mean = [0, 0]
		>>> cov = [[1, 0], [0, 100]]  # diagonal covariance
		
		Diagonal covariance means that points are oriented along x or y-axis:
		
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		>>> x, y = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, 5000).T
		>>> plt.plot(x, y, 'x')
		>>> plt.axis('equal')
		>>> plt.show()
		
		Note that the covariance matrix must be positive semidefinite (a.k.a.
		nonnegative-definite). Otherwise, the behavior of this method is
		undefined and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

		negative_binomial(n, p, size=None)
		
		Draw samples from a negative binomial distribution.
		
		Samples are drawn from a negative binomial distribution with specified
		parameters, `n` successes and `p` probability of success where `n` is an
		integer > 0 and `p` is in the interval [0, 1].
		
		Parameters
		----------
		n : int or array_like of ints
		    Parameter of the distribution, > 0. Floats are also accepted,
		    but they will be truncated to integers.
		p : float or array_like of floats
		    Parameter of the distribution, >= 0 and <=1.
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
		    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
		    a single value is returned if ``n`` and ``p`` are both scalars.
		    Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(n, p).size`` samples are drawn.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray or scalar
		    Drawn samples from the parameterized negative binomial distribution,
		    where each sample is equal to N, the number of failures that
		    occurred before a total of n successes was reached.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The probability density for the negative binomial distribution is
		
		.. math:: P(N;n,p) = \binom{N+n-1}{N}p^{n}(1-p)^{N},
		
		where :math:`n` is the number of successes, :math:`p` is the
		probability of success, and :math:`N+n` is the number of trials.
		The negative binomial distribution gives the probability of N
		failures given n successes, with a success on the last trial.
		
		If one throws a die repeatedly until the third time a "1" appears,
		then the probability distribution of the number of non-"1"s that
		appear before the third "1" is a negative binomial distribution.

		normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)
		
		Draw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
		
		The probability density function of the normal distribution, first
		derived by De Moivre and 200 years later by both Gauss and Laplace
		independently [2]_, is often called the bell curve because of
		its characteristic shape (see the example below).
		
		The normal distributions occurs often in nature.  For example, it
		describes the commonly occurring distribution of samples influenced
		by a large number of tiny, random disturbances, each with its own
		unique distribution [2]_.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		loc : float or array_like of floats
		    Mean ("centre") of the distribution.
		scale : float or array_like of floats
		    Standard deviation (spread or "width") of the distribution.
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
		    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
		    a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
		    Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray or scalar
		    Drawn samples from the parameterized normal distribution.
		
		See Also
		--------
		scipy.stats.norm : probability density function, distribution or
		    cumulative density function, etc.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The probability density for the Gaussian distribution is
		
		.. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 \pi \sigma^2 }}
		                 e^{ - \frac{ (x - \mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} },
		
		where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` the standard
		deviation. The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\sigma^2`,
		is called the variance.
		
		The function has its peak at the mean, and its "spread" increases with
		the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at
		:math:`x + \sigma` and :math:`x - \sigma` [2]_).  This implies that
		`numpy.random.normal` is more likely to return samples lying close to
		the mean, rather than those far away.

		pareto(a, size=None)
		
		Draw samples from a Pareto II or Lomax distribution with
		specified shape.
		
		The Lomax or Pareto II distribution is a shifted Pareto
		distribution. The classical Pareto distribution can be
		obtained from the Lomax distribution by adding 1 and
		multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).  The
		smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the
		classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard
		Pareto distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also
		be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized
		Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set
		to one and the location set to zero.
		
		The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is
		unbounded above.  It is also known as the "80-20 rule".  In
		this distribution, 80 percent of the weights are in the lowest
		20 percent of the range, while the other 20 percent fill the
		remaining 80 percent of the range.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : float or array_like of floats
		    Shape of the distribution. Should be greater than zero.
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
		    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
		    a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,

		-----
		The probability density for the Pareto distribution is
		
		.. math:: p(x) = \frac{am^a}{x^{a+1}}
		
		where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`m` the scale.
		
		The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian economist
		Vilfredo Pareto, is a power law probability distribution
		useful in many real world problems.  Outside the field of
		economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford
		distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe
		the distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found
		use in insurance, web page access statistics, oil field sizes,
		and many other problems, including the download frequency for
		projects in Sourceforge [1]_.  It is one of the so-called
		"fat-tailed" distributions.

		`high` is None (the default), then results are from [0, `low`).
		
		Parameters
		----------
		low : int
		    Lowest (signed) integer to be drawn from the distribution (unless
		    ``high=None``, in which case this parameter is one above the
		    *highest* such integer).
		high : int, optional
		    If provided, one above the largest (signed) integer to be drawn

		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then

		dtype : dtype, optional
		    Desired dtype of the result. All dtypes are determined by their
		    name, i.e., 'int64', 'int', etc, so byteorder is not available
		    and a specific precision may have different C types depending
		    on the platform. The default value is 'np.int'.

		randn(d0, d1, ..., dn)
		
		Return a sample (or samples) from the "standard normal" distribution.
		
		If positive, int_like or int-convertible arguments are provided,
		`randn` generates an array of shape ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``, filled
		with random floats sampled from a univariate "normal" (Gaussian)
		distribution of mean 0 and variance 1 (if any of the :math:`d_i` are
		floats, they are first converted to integers by truncation). A single
		float randomly sampled from the distribution is returned if no
		argument is provided.
		
		This is a convenience function.  If you want an interface that takes a
		tuple as the first argument, use `numpy.random.standard_normal` instead.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		d0, d1, ..., dn : int, optional
		    The dimensions of the returned array, should be all positive.

		The Cauchy distribution arises in the solution to the driven harmonic
		oscillator problem, and also describes spectral line broadening. It

		When studying hypothesis tests that assume normality, seeing how the

		standard_t(df, size=None)
		
		Draw samples from a standard Student's t distribution with `df` degrees
		of freedom.
		
		A special case of the hyperbolic distribution.  As `df` gets
		large, the result resembles that of the standard normal
		distribution (`standard_normal`).
		
		Parameters
		----------
		df : float or array_like of floats
		    Degrees of freedom, should be > 0.
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
		    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
		    a single value is returned if ``df`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
		    ``np.array(df).size`` samples are drawn.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray or scalar
		    Drawn samples from the parameterized standard Student's t distribution.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The probability density function for the t distribution is
		
		.. math:: P(x, df) = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{df+1}{2})}{\sqrt{\pi df}
		          \Gamma(\frac{df}{2})}\Bigl( 1+\frac{x^2}{df} \Bigr)^{-(df+1)/2}
		
		The t test is based on an assumption that the data come from a
		Normal distribution. The t test provides a way to test whether
		the sample mean (that is the mean calculated from the data) is
		a good estimate of the true mean.
		
		The derivation of the t-distribution was first published in
		1908 by William Gosset while working for the Guinness Brewery
		in Dublin. Due to proprietary issues, he had to publish under
		a pseudonym, and so he used the name Student.

		Examples
		--------
		From Dalgaard page 83 [1]_, suppose the daily energy intake for 11
		women in kilojoules (kJ) is:
		
		>>> intake = np.array([5260., 5470, 5640, 6180, 6390, 6515, 6805, 7515, \
		...                    7515, 8230, 8770])
		
		Does their energy intake deviate systematically from the recommended
		value of 7725 kJ?
		
		We have 10 degrees of freedom, so is the sample mean within 95% of the
		recommended value?
		
		>>> s = np.random.standard_t(10, size=100000)
		>>> np.mean(intake)
		6753.636363636364
		>>> intake.std(ddof=1)
		1142.1232221373727
		
		Calculate the t statistic, setting the ddof parameter to the unbiased
		value so the divisor in the standard deviation will be degrees of
		freedom, N-1.
		
		>>> t = (np.mean(intake)-7725)/(intake.std(ddof=1)/np.sqrt(len(intake)))
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		>>> h = plt.hist(s, bins=100, density=True)
		
		For a one-sided t-test, how far out in the distribution does the t
		statistic appear?
		
		>>> np.sum(s<t) / float(len(s))
		0.0090699999999999999  #random
		
		So the p-value is about 0.009, which says the null hypothesis has a
		probability of about 99% of being true.

		triangular(left, mode, right, size=None)
		
		Draw samples from the triangular distribution over the
		interval ``[left, right]``.
		
		The triangular distribution is a continuous probability
		distribution with lower limit left, peak at mode, and upper
		limit right. Unlike the other distributions, these parameters
		directly define the shape of the pdf.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		left : float or array_like of floats
		    Lower limit.
		mode : float or array_like of floats
		    The value where the peak of the distribution occurs.
		    The value should fulfill the condition ``left <= mode <= right``.
		right : float or array_like of floats
		    Upper limit, should be larger than `left`.
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
		    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
		    a single value is returned if ``left``, ``mode``, and ``right``
		    are all scalars.  Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(left, mode, right).size``
		    samples are drawn.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray or scalar
		    Drawn samples from the parameterized triangular distribution.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The probability density function for the triangular distribution is
		
		.. math:: P(x;l, m, r) = \begin{cases}
		          \frac{2(x-l)}{(r-l)(m-l)}& \text{for $l \leq x \leq m$},\\
		          \frac{2(r-x)}{(r-l)(r-m)}& \text{for $m \leq x \leq r$},\\
		          0& \text{otherwise}.
		          \end{cases}
		
		The triangular distribution is often used in ill-defined
		problems where the underlying distribution is not known, but
		some knowledge of the limits and mode exists. Often it is used
		in simulations.

		uniform(low=0.0, high=1.0, size=None)
		
		Draw samples from a uniform distribution.
		
		Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval
		``[low, high)`` (includes low, but excludes high).  In other words,
		any value within the given interval is equally likely to be drawn
		by `uniform`.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		low : float or array_like of floats, optional
		    Lower boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
		    greater than or equal to low.  The default value is 0.
		high : float or array_like of floats
		    Upper boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
		    less than high.  The default value is 1.0.
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
		    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
		    a single value is returned if ``low`` and ``high`` are both scalars.
		    Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(low, high).size`` samples are drawn.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray or scalar
		    Drawn samples from the parameterized uniform distribution.
		
		See Also
		--------
		randint : Discrete uniform distribution, yielding integers.
		random_integers : Discrete uniform distribution over the closed
		                  interval ``[low, high]``.
		random_sample : Floats uniformly distributed over ``[0, 1)``.
		random : Alias for `random_sample`.
		rand : Convenience function that accepts dimensions as input, e.g.,
		       ``rand(2,2)`` would generate a 2-by-2 array of floats,
		       uniformly distributed over ``[0, 1)``.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The probability density function of the uniform distribution is
		
		.. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}
		
		anywhere within the interval ``[a, b)``, and zero elsewhere.
		
		When ``high`` == ``low``, values of ``low`` will be returned.
		If ``high`` < ``low``, the results are officially undefined
		and may eventually raise an error, i.e. do not rely on this
		function to behave when passed arguments satisfying that
		inequality condition.
		
		Examples
		--------

		>>> s = np.random.uniform(-1,0,1000)

		vonmises(mu, kappa, size=None)
		
		Draw samples from a von Mises distribution.
		
		Samples are drawn from a von Mises distribution with specified mode

		The von Mises distribution (also known as the circular normal
		distribution) is a continuous probability distribution on the unit

		Parameters
		----------
		mu : float or array_like of floats

		kappa : float or array_like of floats
		    Dispersion of the distribution, has to be >=0.
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional

		    a single value is returned if ``mu`` and ``kappa`` are both scalars.
		    Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mu, kappa).size`` samples are drawn.

		See Also
		--------

		Notes
		-----
		The probability density for the von Mises distribution is

		where :math:`\mu` is the mode and :math:`\kappa` the dispersion,
		and :math:`I_0(\kappa)` is the modified Bessel function of order 0.
		
		The von Mises is named for Richard Edler von Mises, who was born in
		Austria-Hungary, in what is now the Ukraine.  He fled to the United
		States in 1939 and became a professor at Harvard.  He worked in
		probability theory, aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, and philosophy of

		wald(mean, scale, size=None)
		
		Draw samples from a Wald, or inverse Gaussian, distribution.
		
		As the scale approaches infinity, the distribution becomes more like a
		Gaussian. Some references claim that the Wald is an inverse Gaussian
		with mean equal to 1, but this is by no means universal.
		
		The inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to
		Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name inverse Gaussian
		because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a
		unit distance and distance covered in unit time.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		mean : float or array_like of floats
		    Distribution mean, should be > 0.
		scale : float or array_like of floats
		    Scale parameter, should be >= 0.
		size : int or tuple of ints, optional
		    Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
		    ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
		    a single value is returned if ``mean`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
		    Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mean, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray or scalar
		    Drawn samples from the parameterized Wald distribution.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The probability density function for the Wald distribution is
		
		.. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \sqrt{\frac{scale}{2\pi x^3}}e^
		                            \frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\cdotp mean^2x}
		
		As noted above the inverse Gaussian distribution first arise
		from attempts to model Brownian motion. It is also a
		competitor to the Weibull for use in reliability modeling and
		modeling stock returns and interest rate processes.
