		Compute the future value.
		
		Given:
		 * a present value, `pv`
		 * an interest `rate` compounded once per period, of which
		   there are
		 * `nper` total
		 * a (fixed) payment, `pmt`, paid either
		 * at the beginning (`when` = {'begin', 1}) or the end
		   (`when` = {'end', 0}) of each period
		
		Return:
		   the value at the end of the `nper` periods
		
		Parameters
		----------
		rate : scalar or array_like of shape(M, )
		    Rate of interest as decimal (not per cent) per period
		nper : scalar or array_like of shape(M, )
		    Number of compounding periods
		pmt : scalar or array_like of shape(M, )
		    Payment
		pv : scalar or array_like of shape(M, )
		    Present value
		when : {{'begin', 1}, {'end', 0}}, {string, int}, optional
		    When payments are due ('begin' (1) or 'end' (0)).
		    Defaults to {'end', 0}.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : ndarray
		    Future values.  If all input is scalar, returns a scalar float.  If
		    any input is array_like, returns future values for each input element.
		    If multiple inputs are array_like, they all must have the same shape.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The future value is computed by solving the equation::
		
		 fv +
		 pv*(1+rate)**nper +
		 pmt*(1 + rate*when)/rate*((1 + rate)**nper - 1) == 0
		
		or, when ``rate == 0``::
		
		 fv + pv + pmt * nper == 0

		Examples
		--------
		What is the future value after 10 years of saving $100 now, with
		an additional monthly savings of $100.  Assume the interest rate is
		5% (annually) compounded monthly?
		
		>>> np.fv(0.05/12, 10*12, -100, -100)
		15692.928894335748
		
		By convention, the negative sign represents cash flow out (i.e. money not
		available today).  Thus, saving $100 a month at 5% annual interest leads
		to $15,692.93 available to spend in 10 years.
		
		If any input is array_like, returns an array of equal shape.  Let's
		compare different interest rates from the example above.

		Return the Internal Rate of Return (IRR).
		
		This is the "average" periodically compounded rate of return
		that gives a net present value of 0.0; for a more complete explanation,
		see Notes below.
		
		:class:`decimal.Decimal` type is not supported.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		values : array_like, shape(N,)
		    Input cash flows per time period.  By convention, net "deposits"
		    are negative and net "withdrawals" are positive.  Thus, for
		    example, at least the first element of `values`, which represents
		    the initial investment, will typically be negative.
		
		Returns
		-------
		out : float
		    Internal Rate of Return for periodic input values.
		
		Notes
		-----
		The IRR is perhaps best understood through an example (illustrated
		using np.irr in the Examples section below).  Suppose one invests 100
		units and then makes the following withdrawals at regular (fixed)
		intervals: 39, 59, 55, 20.  Assuming the ending value is 0, one's 100
		unit investment yields 173 units; however, due to the combination of
		compounding and the periodic withdrawals, the "average" rate of return
		is neither simply 0.73/4 nor (1.73)^0.25-1.  Rather, it is the solution
		(for :math:`r`) of the equation:
		
		.. math:: -100 + \frac{39}{1+r} + \frac{59}{(1+r)^2}
		 + \frac{55}{(1+r)^3} + \frac{20}{(1+r)^4} = 0
		
		In general, for `values` :math:`= [v_0, v_1, ... v_M]`,
		irr is the solution of the equation: [G]_
		
		.. math:: \sum_{t=0}^M{\frac{v_t}{(1+irr)^{t}}} = 0

		Examples
		--------
		What is the present value (e.g., the initial investment)
		of an investment that needs to total $15692.93
		after 10 years of saving $100 every month?  Assume the
		interest rate is 5% (annually) compounded monthly.
		
		>>> np.pv(0.05/12, 10*12, -100, 15692.93)
		-100.00067131625819
		
		By convention, the negative sign represents cash flow out
		(i.e., money not available today).  Thus, to end up with
		$15,692.93 in 10 years saving $100 a month at 5% annual
		interest, one's initial deposit should also be $100.
		
		If any input is array_like, ``pv`` returns an array of equal shape.
		Let's compare different interest rates in the example above:
		
		>>> a = np.array((0.05, 0.04, 0.03))/12
		>>> np.pv(a, 10*12, -100, 15692.93)
		array([ -100.00067132,  -649.26771385, -1273.78633713])
		
		So, to end up with the same $15692.93 under the same $100 per month
		"savings plan," for annual interest rates of 4% and 3%, one would
		need initial investments of $649.27 and $1273.79, respectively.
