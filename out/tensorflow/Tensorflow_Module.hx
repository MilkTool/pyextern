		Use tf.print instead of tf.Print. Note that tf.print returns a no-output operator that directly prints the output. Outside of defuns or eager mode, this operator will not be executed unless it is directly specified in session.run or used as a control dependency for other operators. This is only a concern in graph mode. Below is an example of how to ensure tf.print executes in graph mode:
		```python
		    sess = tf.Session()
		    with sess.as_default():
		        tensor = tf.range(10)
		        print_op = tf.print(tensor)

		          out = tf.add(tensor, tensor)
		        sess.run(out)
		    ```
		Additionally, to use tf.print in python 2.7, users must make sure to import
		the following:
		
		  `from __future__ import print_function`
		
		
		This is an identity op (behaves like `tf.identity`) with the side effect
		of printing `data` when evaluating.
		
		Note: This op prints to the standard error. It is not currently compatible
		  with jupyter notebook (printing to the notebook *server's* output, not into

		  input_: A tensor passed through this op.
		  data: A list of tensors to print out when op is evaluated.
		  message: A string, prefix of the error message.
		  first_n: Only log `first_n` number of times. Negative numbers log always;
		           this is the default.
		  summarize: Only print this many entries of each tensor. If None, then a
		             maximum of 3 elements are printed per input tensor.
		  name: A name for the operation (optional).

		    `[batch*block_size*block_size, height_pad/block_size, width_pad/block_size,
		      depth]`. Note that the batch size of the input tensor must be divisible by

		  crops: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`.
		    2-D tensor of non-negative integers with shape `[2, 2]`. It specifies
		    how many elements to crop from the intermediate result across the spatial

		BatchToSpace for N-D tensors of type T.
		
		This operation reshapes the "batch" dimension 0 into `M + 1` dimensions of shape
		`block_shape + [batch]`, interleaves these blocks back into the grid defined by
		the spatial dimensions `[1, ..., M]`, to obtain a result with the same rank as
		the input.  The spatial dimensions of this intermediate result are then
		optionally cropped according to `crops` to produce the output.  This is the
		reverse of SpaceToBatch.  See below for a precise description.
		
		Args:
		  input: A `Tensor`.
		    N-D with shape `input_shape = [batch] + spatial_shape + remaining_shape`,
		    where spatial_shape has M dimensions.
		  block_shape: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`.
		    1-D with shape `[M]`, all values must be >= 1.
		  crops: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`.
		    2-D with shape `[M, 2]`, all values must be >= 0.
		      `crops[i] = [crop_start, crop_end]` specifies the amount to crop from input
		      dimension `i + 1`, which corresponds to spatial dimension `i`.  It is
		      required that
		      `crop_start[i] + crop_end[i] <= block_shape[i] * input_shape[i + 1]`.
		
		    This operation is equivalent to the following steps:
		
		    1. Reshape `input` to `reshaped` of shape:
		         [block_shape[0], ..., block_shape[M-1],
		          batch / prod(block_shape),
		          input_shape[1], ..., input_shape[N-1]]
		
		    2. Permute dimensions of `reshaped` to produce `permuted` of shape
		         [batch / prod(block_shape),
		
		          input_shape[1], block_shape[0],
		          ...,
		          input_shape[M], block_shape[M-1],
		
		          input_shape[M+1], ..., input_shape[N-1]]
		
		    3. Reshape `permuted` to produce `reshaped_permuted` of shape
		         [batch / prod(block_shape),
		
		          input_shape[1] * block_shape[0],
		          ...,
		          input_shape[M] * block_shape[M-1],
		
		          input_shape[M+1],
		          ...,
		          input_shape[N-1]]
		
		    4. Crop the start and end of dimensions `[1, ..., M]` of
		       `reshaped_permuted` according to `crops` to produce the output of shape:
		         [batch / prod(block_shape),
		
		          input_shape[1] * block_shape[0] - crops[0,0] - crops[0,1],
		          ...,

		`true_fn` and `false_fn` both return lists of output tensors. `true_fn` and

		**WARNING**: Any Tensors or Operations created outside of `true_fn` and
		`false_fn` will be executed regardless of which branch is selected at runtime.
		
		Although this behavior is consistent with the dataflow model of TensorFlow,
		it has frequently surprised users who expected a lazier semantics.
		Consider the following simple program:
		
		```python
		z = tf.multiply(a, b)

		```
		
		If `x < y`, the `tf.add` operation will be executed and `tf.square`

		unconditionally.
		
		Note that `cond` calls `true_fn` and `false_fn` *exactly once* (inside the

		stitches together the graph fragments created during the `true_fn` and
		`false_fn` calls with some additional graph nodes to ensure that the right
		branch gets executed depending on the value of `pred`.
		
		`tf.cond` supports nested structures as implemented in
		`tensorflow.python.util.nest`. Both `true_fn` and `false_fn` must return the
		same (possibly nested) value structure of lists, tuples, and/or named tuples.
		Singleton lists and tuples form the only exceptions to this: when returned by
		`true_fn` and/or `false_fn`, they are implicitly unpacked to single values.
		This behavior is disabled by passing `strict=True`.
		
		Args:
		  pred: A scalar determining whether to return the result of `true_fn` or
		    `false_fn`.
		  true_fn: The callable to be performed if pred is true.
		  false_fn: The callable to be performed if pred is false.
		  strict: A boolean that enables/disables 'strict' mode; see above.
		  name: Optional name prefix for the returned tensors.

		Decorator to define a function with a custom gradient.
		
		This decorator allows fine grained control over the gradients of a sequence
		for operations.  This may be useful for multiple reasons, including providing
		a more efficient or numerically stable gradient for a sequence of operations.
		
		For example, consider the following function that commonly occurs in the
		computation of cross entropy and log likelihoods:
		
		```python
		def log1pexp(x):
		  return tf.log(1 + tf.exp(x))
		```
		
		Due to numerical instability, the gradient this function evaluated at x=100 is
		NaN.  For example:
		
		```python
		x = tf.constant(100.)
		y = log1pexp(x)
		dy = tf.gradients(y, x) # Will be NaN when evaluated.
		```
		
		The gradient expression can be analytically simplified to provide numerical
		stability:
		
		```python
		@tf.custom_gradient
		def log1pexp(x):
		  e = tf.exp(x)
		  def grad(dy):
		    return dy * (1 - 1 / (1 + e))
		  return tf.log(1 + e), grad
		```
		
		With this definition, the gradient at x=100 will be correctly evaluated as
		1.0.
		
		See also `tf.RegisterGradient` which registers a gradient function for a
		primitive TensorFlow operation. `tf.custom_gradient` on the other hand allows
		for fine grained control over the gradient computation of a sequence of
		operations.
		
		Note that if the decorated function uses `Variable`s, the enclosing variable
		scope must be using `ResourceVariable`s.
		
		Args:
		  f: function `f(*x)` that returns a tuple `(y, grad_fn)` where:
		     - `x` is a sequence of `Tensor` inputs to the function.
		     - `y` is a `Tensor` or sequence of `Tensor` outputs of applying
		       TensorFlow operations in `f` to `x`.
		     - `grad_fn` is a function with the signature `g(*grad_ys)` which returns
		       a list of `Tensor`s - the derivatives of `Tensor`s in `y` with respect
		       to the `Tensor`s in `x`.  `grad_ys` is a `Tensor` or sequence of
		       `Tensor`s the same size as `y` holding the initial value gradients for
		       each `Tensor` in `y`. If `f` uses `Variable`s (that are not part of the

		DepthToSpace for tensors of type T.
		
		Rearranges data from depth into blocks of spatial data.
		This is the reverse transformation of SpaceToDepth. More specifically,
		this op outputs a copy of the input tensor where values from the `depth`
		dimension are moved in spatial blocks to the `height` and `width` dimensions.
		The attr `block_size` indicates the input block size and how the data is moved.
		
		  * Chunks of data of size `block_size * block_size` from depth are rearranged
		    into non-overlapping blocks of size `block_size x block_size`
		  * The width the output tensor is `input_depth * block_size`, whereas the
		    height is `input_height * block_size`.
		  * The Y, X coordinates within each block of the output image are determined
		    by the high order component of the input channel index.
		  * The depth of the input tensor must be divisible by
		    `block_size * block_size`.
		
		The `data_format` attr specifies the layout of the input and output tensors
		with the following options:
		  "NHWC": `[ batch, height, width, channels ]`
		  "NCHW": `[ batch, channels, height, width ]`
		  "NCHW_VECT_C":
		      `qint8 [ batch, channels / 4, height, width, 4 ]`
		
		It is useful to consider the operation as transforming a 6-D Tensor.
		e.g. for data_format = NHWC,
		     Each element in the input tensor can be specified via 6 coordinates,
		     ordered by decreasing memory layout significance as:
		     n,iY,iX,bY,bX,oC  (where n=batch index, iX, iY means X or Y coordinates
		                        within the input image, bX, bY means coordinates
		                        within the output block, oC means output channels).
		     The output would be the input transposed to the following layout:
		     n,iY,bY,iX,bX,oC
		
		This operation is useful for resizing the activations between convolutions
		(but keeping all data), e.g. instead of pooling. It is also useful for training
		purely convolutional models.
		
		For example, given an input of shape `[1, 1, 1, 4]`, data_format = "NHWC" and
		block_size = 2:
		
		```
		x = [[[[1, 2, 3, 4]]]]
		
		```
		
		This operation will output a tensor of shape `[1, 2, 2, 1]`:
		
		```
		   [[[[1], [2]],
		     [[3], [4]]]]
		```
		
		Here, the input has a batch of 1 and each batch element has shape `[1, 1, 4]`,
		the corresponding output will have 2x2 elements and will have a depth of
		1 channel (1 = `4 / (block_size * block_size)`).
		The output element shape is `[2, 2, 1]`.
		
		For an input tensor with larger depth, here of shape `[1, 1, 1, 12]`, e.g.
		
		```
		x = [[[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]]]]
		```
		
		This operation, for block size of 2, will return the following tensor of shape
		`[1, 2, 2, 3]`
		
		```
		   [[[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],
		     [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]]]
		
		```
		
		Similarly, for the following input of shape `[1 2 2 4]`, and a block size of 2:
		
		```
		x =  [[[[1, 2, 3, 4],
		       [5, 6, 7, 8]],
		      [[9, 10, 11, 12],
		       [13, 14, 15, 16]]]]
		```
		
		the operator will return the following tensor of shape `[1 4 4 1]`:
		
		```
		x = [[[ [1],   [2],  [5],  [6]],
		      [ [3],   [4],  [7],  [8]],

		Dequantize the 'input' tensor into a float Tensor.
		
		[min_range, max_range] are scalar floats that specify the range for
		the 'input' data. The 'mode' attribute controls exactly which calculations are
		used to convert the float values to their quantized equivalents.
		
		In 'MIN_COMBINED' mode, each value of the tensor will undergo the following:
		
		```
		if T == qint8, in[i] += (range(T) + 1)/ 2.0
		out[i] = min_range + (in[i]* (max_range - min_range) / range(T))
		```
		here `range(T) = numeric_limits<T>::max() - numeric_limits<T>::min()`
		
		*MIN_COMBINED Mode Example*
		
		If the input comes from a QuantizedRelu6, the output type is
		quint8 (range of 0-255) but the possible range of QuantizedRelu6 is
		0-6.  The min_range and max_range values are therefore 0.0 and 6.0.
		Dequantize on quint8 will take each value, cast to float, and multiply
		by 6 / 255.
		Note that if quantizedtype is qint8, the operation will additionally add
		each value by 128 prior to casting.
		
		If the mode is 'MIN_FIRST', then this approach is used:
		
		```c++
		num_discrete_values = 1 << (# of bits in T)
		range_adjust = num_discrete_values / (num_discrete_values - 1)
		range = (range_max - range_min) * range_adjust
		range_scale = range / num_discrete_values
		const double offset_input = static_cast<double>(input) - lowest_quantized;
		result = range_min + ((input - numeric_limits<T>::min()) * range_scale)
		```
		
		*SCALED mode Example*
		
		`SCALED` mode matches the quantization approach used in
		`QuantizeAndDequantize{V2|V3}`.
		
		If the mode is `SCALED`, we do not use the full range of the output type,
		choosing to elide the lowest possible value for symmetry (e.g., output range is
		-127 to 127, not -128 to 127 for signed 8 bit quantization), so that 0.0 maps to
		0.
		
		We first find the range of values in our tensor. The
		range we use is always centered on 0, so we find m such that
		```c++
		  m = max(abs(input_min), abs(input_max))
		```
		
		Our input tensor range is then `[-m, m]`.
		
		Next, we choose our fixed-point quantization buckets, `[min_fixed, max_fixed]`.
		If T is signed, this is
		```
		  num_bits = sizeof(T) * 8
		  [min_fixed, max_fixed] =
		      [-(1 << (num_bits - 1) - 1), (1 << (num_bits - 1)) - 1]
		```
		
		Otherwise, if T is unsigned, the fixed-point range is
		```
		  [min_fixed, max_fixed] = [0, (1 << num_bits) - 1]
		```
		
		From this we compute our scaling factor, s:
		```c++
		  s = (2 * m) / (max_fixed - min_fixed)
		```
		
		Now we can dequantize the elements of our tensor:
		```c++
		result = input * s
		```

		A generalized contraction between tensors of arbitrary dimension.
		
		This function returns a tensor whose elements are defined by `equation`,

		```
		  C[i,k] = sum_j A[i,j] * B[j,k]
		```
		
		The corresponding `equation` is:
		
		```
		  ij,jk->ik

		In general, the `equation` is obtained from the more familiar element-wise
		equation by
		  1. removing variable names, brackets, and commas,
		  2. replacing "*" with ",",
		  3. dropping summation signs, and
		  4. moving the output to the right, and replacing "=" with "->".
		
		Many common operations can be expressed in this way.  For example:
		
		```python
		# Matrix multiplication
		>>> einsum('ij,jk->ik', m0, m1)  # output[i,k] = sum_j m0[i,j] * m1[j, k]
		
		# Dot product
		>>> einsum('i,i->', u, v)  # output = sum_i u[i]*v[i]
		
		# Outer product

		# Transpose
		>>> einsum('ij->ji', m)  # output[j,i] = m[i,j]
		
		# Batch matrix multiplication
		>>> einsum('aij,ajk->aik', s, t)  # out[a,i,k] = sum_j s[a,i,j] * t[a, j, k]
		```

		* Ellipses (subscripts like `ij...,jk...->ik...`)
		* Subscripts where an axis appears more than once for a single input

		Inserts a dimension of 1 into a tensor's shape. (deprecated arguments)
		
		SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED. They will be removed in a future version.
		Instructions for updating:
		Use the `axis` argument instead
		
		Given a tensor `input`, this operation inserts a dimension of 1 at the
		dimension index `axis` of `input`'s shape. The dimension index `axis` starts
		at zero; if you specify a negative number for `axis` it is counted backward
		from the end.
		
		This operation is useful if you want to add a batch dimension to a single
		element. For example, if you have a single image of shape `[height, width,
		channels]`, you can make it a batch of 1 image with `expand_dims(image, 0)`,
		which will make the shape `[1, height, width, channels]`.
		
		Other examples:
		
		```python
		# 't' is a tensor of shape [2]
		tf.shape(tf.expand_dims(t, 0))  # [1, 2]
		tf.shape(tf.expand_dims(t, 1))  # [2, 1]
		tf.shape(tf.expand_dims(t, -1))  # [2, 1]
		
		# 't2' is a tensor of shape [2, 3, 5]
		tf.shape(tf.expand_dims(t2, 0))  # [1, 2, 3, 5]
		tf.shape(tf.expand_dims(t2, 2))  # [2, 3, 1, 5]
		tf.shape(tf.expand_dims(t2, 3))  # [2, 3, 5, 1]
		```
		
		This operation requires that:
		
		`-1-input.dims() <= dim <= input.dims()`
		
		This operation is related to `squeeze()`, which removes dimensions of
		size 1.
		
		Args:
		  input: A `Tensor`.
		  axis: 0-D (scalar). Specifies the dimension index at which to
		    expand the shape of `input`. Must be in the range
		    `[-rank(input) - 1, rank(input)]`.
		  name: The name of the output `Tensor`.

		Returns:
		  A `Tensor` with the same data as `input`, but its shape has an additional
		  dimension of size 1 added.
		
		Raises:

		Gather slices from `params` into a Tensor with shape specified by `indices`.
		
		`indices` is an K-dimensional integer tensor, best thought of as a
		(K-1)-dimensional tensor of indices into `params`, where each element defines a
		slice of `params`:
		
		    output[\\(i_0, ..., i_{K-2}\\)] = params[indices[\\(i_0, ..., i_{K-2}\\)]]
		
		Whereas in `tf.gather` `indices` defines slices into the first
		dimension of `params`, in `tf.gather_nd`, `indices` defines slices into the
		first `N` dimensions of `params`, where `N = indices.shape[-1]`.
		
		The last dimension of `indices` can be at most the rank of
		`params`:
		
		    indices.shape[-1] <= params.rank
		
		The last dimension of `indices` corresponds to elements
		(if `indices.shape[-1] == params.rank`) or slices
		(if `indices.shape[-1] < params.rank`) along dimension `indices.shape[-1]`
		of `params`.  The output tensor has shape
		
		    indices.shape[:-1] + params.shape[indices.shape[-1]:]
		
		Note that on CPU, if an out of bound index is found, an error is returned.
		On GPU, if an out of bound index is found, a 0 is stored in the

		This function prefixes the name with the current variable scope
		and performs reuse checks. See the
		[Variable Scope How To](https://tensorflow.org/guide/variables)

		```python
		def foo():

		If initializer is `None` (the default), the default initializer passed in
		the variable scope will be used. If that one is `None` too, a
		`glorot_uniform_initializer` will be used. The initializer can also be
		a Tensor, in which case the variable is initialized to this value and shape.
		
		Similarly, if the regularizer is `None` (the default), the default regularizer

		If a partitioner is provided, a `PartitionedVariable` is returned.

		the partition axis.
		
		Some useful partitioners are available.  See, e.g.,
		`variable_axis_size_partitioner` and `min_max_variable_partitioner`.
		
		Args:
		  name: The name of the new or existing variable.
		  shape: Shape of the new or existing variable.
		  dtype: Type of the new or existing variable (defaults to `DT_FLOAT`).
		  initializer: Initializer for the variable if one is created. Can either be
		    an initializer object or a Tensor. If it's a Tensor, its shape must be known
		    unless validate_shape is False.
		  regularizer: A (Tensor -> Tensor or None) function; the result of
		    applying it on a newly created variable will be added to the collection
		    `tf.GraphKeys.REGULARIZATION_LOSSES` and can be used for regularization.
		  collections: List of graph collections keys to add the Variable to.
		    Defaults to `[GraphKeys.LOCAL_VARIABLES]` (see `tf.Variable`).
		  caching_device: Optional device string or function describing where the
		    Variable should be cached for reading.  Defaults to the Variable's
		    device.  If not `None`, caches on another device.  Typical use is to
		    cache on the device where the Ops using the Variable reside, to
		    deduplicate copying through `Switch` and other conditional statements.
		  partitioner: Optional callable that accepts a fully defined `TensorShape`
		    and `dtype` of the Variable to be created, and returns a list of
		    partitions for each axis (currently only one axis can be partitioned).
		  validate_shape: If False, allows the variable to be initialized with a
		      value of unknown shape. If True, the default, the shape of initial_value
		      must be known. For this to be used the initializer must be a Tensor and
		      not an initializer object.
		  use_resource: If False, creates a regular Variable. If true, creates an
		    experimental ResourceVariable instead with well-defined semantics.
		    Defaults to False (will later change to True). When eager execution is
		    enabled this argument is always forced to be True.
		  custom_getter: Callable that takes as a first argument the true getter, and
		    allows overwriting the internal get_variable method.
		    The signature of `custom_getter` should match that of this method,
		    but the most future-proof version will allow for changes:

		    ```
		  constraint: An optional projection function to be applied to the variable
		    after being updated by an `Optimizer` (e.g. used to implement norm
		    constraints or value constraints for layer weights). The function must
		    take as input the unprojected Tensor representing the value of the
		    variable and return the Tensor for the projected value
		    (which must have the same shape). Constraints are not safe to
		    use when doing asynchronous distributed training.
		  synchronization: Indicates when a distributed a variable will be
		    aggregated. Accepted values are constants defined in the class
		    `tf.VariableSynchronization`. By default the synchronization is set to
		    `AUTO` and the current `DistributionStrategy` chooses
		    when to synchronize. If `synchronization` is set to `ON_READ`,

		    Accepted values are constants defined in the class

		Global variables are variables that are shared across machines in a
		distributed environment. The `Variable()` constructor or `get_variable()`
		automatically adds new variables to the graph collection
		`GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES`.
		This convenience function returns the contents of that collection.
		
		An alternative to global variables are local variables. See
		`tf.local_variables`
		
		Args:
		  scope: (Optional.) A string. If supplied, the resulting list is filtered
		    to include only items whose `name` attribute matches `scope` using
		    `re.match`. Items without a `name` attribute are never returned if a
		    scope is supplied. The choice of `re.match` means that a `scope` without
		    special tokens filters by prefix.
		
		Returns:
		  A list of `Variable` objects.

	/**
		Constructs symbolic derivatives of sum of `ys` w.r.t. x in `xs`.
		
		`ys` and `xs` are each a `Tensor` or a list of tensors.  `grad_ys`
		is a list of `Tensor`, holding the gradients received by the
		`ys`. The list must be the same length as `ys`.
		
		`gradients()` adds ops to the graph to output the derivatives of `ys` with
		respect to `xs`.  It returns a list of `Tensor` of length `len(xs)` where
		each tensor is the `sum(dy/dx)` for y in `ys`.
		
		`grad_ys` is a list of tensors of the same length as `ys` that holds
		the initial gradients for each y in `ys`.  When `grad_ys` is None,
		we fill in a tensor of '1's of the shape of y for each y in `ys`.  A
		user can provide their own initial `grad_ys` to compute the
		derivatives using a different initial gradient for each y (e.g., if
		one wanted to weight the gradient differently for each value in
		each y).
		
		`stop_gradients` is a `Tensor` or a list of tensors to be considered constant
		with respect to all `xs`. These tensors will not be backpropagated through,
		as though they had been explicitly disconnected using `stop_gradient`.  Among
		other things, this allows computation of partial derivatives as opposed to
		total derivatives. For example:
		
		```python
		a = tf.constant(0.)
		b = 2 * a
		g = tf.gradients(a + b, [a, b], stop_gradients=[a, b])
		```
		
		Here the partial derivatives `g` evaluate to `[1.0, 1.0]`, compared to the
		total derivatives `tf.gradients(a + b, [a, b])`, which take into account the
		influence of `a` on `b` and evaluate to `[3.0, 1.0]`.  Note that the above is
		equivalent to:
		
		```python
		a = tf.stop_gradient(tf.constant(0.))
		b = tf.stop_gradient(2 * a)
		g = tf.gradients(a + b, [a, b])
		```
		
		`stop_gradients` provides a way of stopping gradient after the graph has
		already been constructed, as compared to `tf.stop_gradient` which is used
		during graph construction.  When the two approaches are combined,
		backpropagation stops at both `tf.stop_gradient` nodes and nodes in
		`stop_gradients`, whichever is encountered first.
		
		All integer tensors are considered constant with respect to all `xs`, as if
		they were included in `stop_gradients`.
		
		Args:

		A context manager that lifts ops out of control-flow scopes and function-building graphs.
		
		There is often a need to lift variable initialization ops out of control-flow
		scopes, function-building graphs, and gradient tapes. Entering an
		`init_scope` is a mechanism for satisfying these desiderata. In particular,
		entering an `init_scope` has three effects:
		
		  (1) All control dependencies are cleared the moment the scope is entered;
		      this is equivalent to entering the context manager returned from
		      `control_dependencies(None)`, which has the side-effect of exiting
		      control-flow scopes like `tf.cond` and `tf.while_loop`.
		
		  (2) All operations that are created while the scope is active are lifted
		      into the lowest context on the `context_stack` that is not building a
		      graph function. Here, a context is defined as either a graph or an eager
		      context. Every context switch, i.e., every installation of a graph as
		      the default graph and every switch into eager mode, is logged in a
		      thread-local stack called `context_switches`; the log entry for a
		      context switch is popped from the stack when the context is exited.
		      Entering an `init_scope` is equivalent to crawling up
		      `context_switches`, finding the first context that is not building a
		      graph function, and entering it. A caveat is that if graph mode is
		      enabled but the default graph stack is empty, then entering an
		      `init_scope` will simply install a fresh graph as the default one.
		
		  (3) The gradient tape is paused while the scope is active.
		
		When eager execution is enabled, code inside an init_scope block runs with
		eager execution enabled even when defining graph functions via
		tf.contrib.eager.defun. For example:
		
		```python
		tf.enable_eager_execution()
		
		@tf.contrib.eager.defun
		def func():
		  # A defun-decorated function constructs TensorFlow graphs,
		  # it does not execute eagerly.
		  assert not tf.executing_eagerly()

		Given an arbitrary function, wrap it so that it does variable sharing.
		
		This wraps `func_` in a Template and partially evaluates it. Templates are
		functions that create variables the first time they are called and reuse them
		thereafter. In order for `func_` to be compatible with a `Template` it must
		have the following properties:
		
		* The function should create all trainable variables and any variables that
		   should be reused by calling `tf.get_variable`. If a trainable variable is
		   created using `tf.Variable`, then a ValueError will be thrown. Variables
		   that are intended to be locals can be created by specifying
		   `tf.Variable(..., trainable=false)`.
		* The function may use variable scopes and other templates internally to
		    create and reuse variables, but it shouldn't use `tf.global_variables` to
		    capture variables that are defined outside of the scope of the function.
		* Internal scopes and variable names should not depend on any arguments that
		    are not supplied to `make_template`. In general you will get a ValueError
		    telling you that you are trying to reuse a variable that doesn't exist
		    if you make a mistake.
		
		In the following example, both `z` and `w` will be scaled by the same `y`. It
		is important to note that if we didn't assign `scalar_name` and used a
		different name for z and w that a `ValueError` would be thrown because it
		couldn't reuse the variable.
		
		```python
		def my_op(x, scalar_name):
		  var1 = tf.get_variable(scalar_name,
		                         shape=[],
		                         initializer=tf.constant_initializer(1))
		  return x * var1
		
		scale_by_y = tf.make_template('scale_by_y', my_op, scalar_name='y')
		
		z = scale_by_y(input1)
		w = scale_by_y(input2)
		```
		
		As a safe-guard, the returned function will raise a `ValueError` after the
		first call if trainable variables are created by calling `tf.Variable`.
		
		If all of these are true, then 2 properties are enforced by the template:
		
		1. Calling the same template multiple times will share all non-local
		    variables.
		2. Two different templates are guaranteed to be unique, unless you reenter the
		    same variable scope as the initial definition of a template and redefine
		    it. An examples of this exception:
		
		```python
		def my_op(x, scalar_name):
		  var1 = tf.get_variable(scalar_name,
		                         shape=[],
		                         initializer=tf.constant_initializer(1))
		  return x * var1
		
		with tf.variable_scope('scope') as vs:
		  scale_by_y = tf.make_template('scale_by_y', my_op, scalar_name='y')
		  z = scale_by_y(input1)
		  w = scale_by_y(input2)
		
		# Creates a template that reuses the variables above.
		with tf.variable_scope(vs, reuse=True):
		  scale_by_y2 = tf.make_template('scale_by_y', my_op, scalar_name='y')
		  z2 = scale_by_y2(input1)
		  w2 = scale_by_y2(input2)
		```
		
		Depending on the value of `create_scope_now_`, the full variable scope may be
		captured either at the time of first call or at the time of construction. If
		this option is set to True, then all Tensors created by repeated calls to the
		template will have an extra trailing _N+1 to their name, as the first time the
		scope is entered in the Template constructor no Tensors are created.
		
		Note: `name_`, `func_` and `create_scope_now_` have a trailing underscore to
		reduce the likelihood of collisions with kwargs.
		
		Args:
		  name_: A name for the scope created by this template. If necessary, the name
		    will be made unique by appending `_N` to the name.
		  func_: The function to wrap.
		  create_scope_now_: Boolean controlling whether the scope should be created
		    when the template is constructed or when the template is called. Default
		    is False, meaning the scope is created when the template is called.
		  unique_name_: When used, it overrides name_ and is not made unique. If a
		    template of the same scope/unique_name already exists and reuse is false,
		    an error is raised. Defaults to None.

		Returns:
		  A function to encapsulate a set of variables which should be created once

		  `create_scope_now_`. Regardless of the value, the first time the template
		  is called it will enter the scope with no reuse, and call `func_` to create
		  variables, which are guaranteed to be unique. All subsequent calls will
		  re-enter the scope and reuse those variables.

		map on the list of tensors unpacked from `elems` on dimension 0.
		
		The simplest version of `map_fn` repeatedly applies the callable `fn` to a
		sequence of elements from first to last. The elements are made of the
		tensors unpacked from `elems`. `dtype` is the data type of the return
		value of `fn`. Users must provide `dtype` if it is different from
		the data type of `elems`.
		
		Suppose that `elems` is unpacked into `values`, a list of tensors. The shape
		of the result tensor is `[values.shape[0]] + fn(values[0]).shape`.
		
		This method also allows multi-arity `elems` and output of `fn`.  If `elems`
		is a (possibly nested) list or tuple of tensors, then each of these tensors
		must have a matching first (unpack) dimension.  The signature of `fn` may
		match the structure of `elems`.  That is, if `elems` is
		`(t1, [t2, t3, [t4, t5]])`, then an appropriate signature for `fn` is:
		`fn = lambda (t1, [t2, t3, [t4, t5]]):`.
		
		Furthermore, `fn` may emit a different structure than its input.  For example,
		`fn` may look like: `fn = lambda t1: return (t1 + 1, t1 - 1)`.  In this case,
		the `dtype` parameter is not optional: `dtype` must be a type or (possibly
		nested) tuple of types matching the output of `fn`.
		
		To apply a functional operation to the nonzero elements of a SparseTensor
		one of the following methods is recommended. First, if the function is
		expressible as TensorFlow ops, use
		
		```python
		  result = SparseTensor(input.indices, fn(input.values), input.dense_shape)
		```
		
		If, however, the function is not expressible as a TensorFlow op, then use
		
		```python
		result = SparseTensor(
		  input.indices, map_fn(fn, input.values), input.dense_shape)
		```
		
		instead.
		
		When executing eagerly, map_fn does not execute in parallel even if
		`parallel_iterations` is set to a value > 1. You can still get the
		performance benefits of running a function in parallel by using the
		`tf.contrib.eager.defun` decorator,
		
		```python
		# Assume the function being used in map_fn is fn.
		# To ensure map_fn calls fn in parallel, use the defun decorator.
		@tf.contrib.eager.defun
		def func(tensor):
		  return tf.map_fn(fn, tensor)
		```
		
		Note that if you use the defun decorator, any non-TensorFlow Python code
		that you may have written in your function won't get executed. See
		`tf.contrib.eager.defun` for more details. The recommendation would be to
		debug without defun but switch to defun to get performance benefits of
		running map_fn in parallel.
		
		Args:
		  fn: The callable to be performed.  It accepts one argument, which will
		    have the same (possibly nested) structure as `elems`.  Its output
		    must have the same structure as `dtype` if one is provided, otherwise
		    it must have the same structure as `elems`.
		  elems: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, each of which
		    will be unpacked along their first dimension.  The nested sequence
		    of the resulting slices will be applied to `fn`.
		  dtype: (optional) The output type(s) of `fn`.  If `fn` returns a structure
		    of Tensors differing from the structure of `elems`, then `dtype` is not
		    optional and must have the same structure as the output of `fn`.
		  parallel_iterations: (optional) The number of iterations allowed to run
		    in parallel. When graph building, the default value is 10. While executing
		    eagerly, the default value is set to 1.
		  back_prop: (optional) True enables support for back propagation.
		  swap_memory: (optional) True enables GPU-CPU memory swapping.
		  infer_shape: (optional) False disables tests for consistent output shapes.
		  name: (optional) Name prefix for the returned tensors.
		
		Returns:
		  A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors.  Each tensor packs the

		Raises:
		  TypeError: if `fn` is not callable or the structure of the output of
		    `fn` and `dtype` do not match, or if elems is a SparseTensor.
		  ValueError: if the lengths of the output of `fn` and `dtype` do not match.
		
		Examples:
		  ```python
		  elems = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
		  squares = map_fn(lambda x: x * x, elems)
		  # squares == [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]

		Multiplies matrix `a` by matrix `b`, producing `a` * `b`.
		
		The inputs must, following any transpositions, be tensors of rank >= 2
		where the inner 2 dimensions specify valid matrix multiplication arguments,

		Both matrices must be of the same type. The supported types are:
		`float16`, `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `complex64`, `complex128`.
		
		Either matrix can be transposed or adjointed (conjugated and transposed) on
		the fly by setting one of the corresponding flag to `True`. These are `False`
		by default.
		
		If one or both of the matrices contain a lot of zeros, a more efficient
		multiplication algorithm can be used by setting the corresponding
		`a_is_sparse` or `b_is_sparse` flag to `True`. These are `False` by default.
		This optimization is only available for plain matrices (rank-2 tensors) with
		datatypes `bfloat16` or `float32`.

		Computes the norm of vectors, matrices, and tensors. (deprecated arguments)
		
		SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED. They will be removed in a future version.
		Instructions for updating:
		keep_dims is deprecated, use keepdims instead
		
		This function can compute several different vector norms (the 1-norm, the
		Euclidean or 2-norm, the inf-norm, and in general the p-norm for p > 0) and
		matrix norms (Frobenius, 1-norm, 2-norm and inf-norm).
		
		Args:
		  tensor: `Tensor` of types `float32`, `float64`, `complex64`, `complex128`
		  ord: Order of the norm. Supported values are 'fro', 'euclidean',
		    `1`, `2`, `np.inf` and any positive real number yielding the corresponding
		    p-norm. Default is 'euclidean' which is equivalent to Frobenius norm if
		    `tensor` is a matrix and equivalent to 2-norm for vectors.
		    Some restrictions apply:
		      a) The Frobenius norm `fro` is not defined for vectors,
		      b) If axis is a 2-tuple (matrix norm), only 'euclidean', 'fro', `1`,
		         `2`, `np.inf` are supported.
		    See the description of `axis` on how to compute norms for a batch of
		    vectors or matrices stored in a tensor.
		  axis: If `axis` is `None` (the default), the input is considered a vector
		    and a single vector norm is computed over the entire set of values in the
		    tensor, i.e. `norm(tensor, ord=ord)` is equivalent to
		    `norm(reshape(tensor, [-1]), ord=ord)`.
		    If `axis` is a Python integer, the input is considered a batch of vectors,
		    and `axis` determines the axis in `tensor` over which to compute vector
		    norms.
		    If `axis` is a 2-tuple of Python integers it is considered a batch of
		    matrices and `axis` determines the axes in `tensor` over which to compute
		    a matrix norm.
		    Negative indices are supported. Example: If you are passing a tensor that
		    can be either a matrix or a batch of matrices at runtime, pass
		    `axis=[-2,-1]` instead of `axis=None` to make sure that matrix norms are
		    computed.
		  keepdims: If True, the axis indicated in `axis` are kept with size 1.
		    Otherwise, the dimensions in `axis` are removed from the output shape.
		  name: The name of the op.
		  keep_dims: Deprecated alias for `keepdims`.
		
		Returns:
		  output: A `Tensor` of the same type as tensor, containing the vector or
		    matrix norms. If `keepdims` is True then the rank of output is equal to
		    the rank of `tensor`. Otherwise, if `axis` is none the output is a scalar,
		    if `axis` is an integer, the rank of `output` is one less than the rank
		    of `tensor`, if `axis` is a 2-tuple the rank of `output` is two less
		    than the rank of `tensor`.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If `ord` or `axis` is invalid.
		
		@compatibility(numpy)
		Mostly equivalent to numpy.linalg.norm.
		Not supported: ord <= 0, 2-norm for matrices, nuclear norm.
		Other differences:
		  a) If axis is `None`, treats the flattened `tensor` as a vector
		   regardless of rank.
		  b) Explicitly supports 'euclidean' norm as the default, including for
		   higher order tensors.

		Parses `Example` protos into a `dict` of tensors.
		
		Parses a number of serialized [`Example`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/example/example.proto)
		protos given in `serialized`. We refer to `serialized` as a batch with
		`batch_size` many entries of individual `Example` protos.
		
		`example_names` may contain descriptive names for the corresponding serialized
		protos. These may be useful for debugging purposes, but they have no effect on
		the output. If not `None`, `example_names` must be the same length as
		`serialized`.
		
		This op parses serialized examples into a dictionary mapping keys to `Tensor`
		and `SparseTensor` objects. `features` is a dict from keys to `VarLenFeature`,
		`SparseFeature`, and `FixedLenFeature` objects. Each `VarLenFeature`
		and `SparseFeature` is mapped to a `SparseTensor`, and each
		`FixedLenFeature` is mapped to a `Tensor`.
		
		Each `VarLenFeature` maps to a `SparseTensor` of the specified type
		representing a ragged matrix. Its indices are `[batch, index]` where `batch`
		identifies the example in `serialized`, and `index` is the value's index in
		the list of values associated with that feature and example.
		
		Each `SparseFeature` maps to a `SparseTensor` of the specified type
		representing a Tensor of `dense_shape` `[batch_size] + SparseFeature.size`.
		Its `values` come from the feature in the examples with key `value_key`.
		A `values[i]` comes from a position `k` in the feature of an example at batch
		entry `batch`. This positional information is recorded in `indices[i]` as
		`[batch, index_0, index_1, ...]` where `index_j` is the `k-th` value of
		the feature in the example at with key `SparseFeature.index_key[j]`.
		In other words, we split the indices (except the first index indicating the
		batch entry) of a `SparseTensor` by dimension into different features of the
		`Example`. Due to its complexity a `VarLenFeature` should be preferred over a
		`SparseFeature` whenever possible.
		
		Each `FixedLenFeature` `df` maps to a `Tensor` of the specified type (or
		`tf.float32` if not specified) and shape `(serialized.size(),) + df.shape`.
		
		`FixedLenFeature` entries with a `default_value` are optional. With no default
		value, we will fail if that `Feature` is missing from any example in
		`serialized`.
		
		Each `FixedLenSequenceFeature` `df` maps to a `Tensor` of the specified type
		(or `tf.float32` if not specified) and shape
		`(serialized.size(), None) + df.shape`.
		All examples in `serialized` will be padded with `default_value` along the
		second dimension.
		
		Examples:
		
		For example, if one expects a `tf.float32` `VarLenFeature` `ft` and three
		serialized `Example`s are provided:
		
		```
		serialized = [

		then the output will look like:

		                    dense_shape=(3, 2)) }
		```
		
		If instead a `FixedLenSequenceFeature` with `default_value = -1.0` and
		`shape=[]` is used then the output will look like:
		
		```python
		{"ft": [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, -1.0]]}
		```
		
		Given two `Example` input protos in `serialized`:
		
		```
		[
		  features {
		    feature { key: "kw" value { bytes_list { value: [ "knit", "big" ] } } }
		    feature { key: "gps" value { float_list { value: [] } } }
		  },
		  features {
		    feature { key: "kw" value { bytes_list { value: [ "emmy" ] } } }
		    feature { key: "dank" value { int64_list { value: [ 42 ] } } }
		    feature { key: "gps" value { } }
		  }
		]
		```
		
		And arguments
		
		```
		example_names: ["input0", "input1"],
		features: {
		    "kw": VarLenFeature(tf.string),
		    "dank": VarLenFeature(tf.int64),
		    "gps": VarLenFeature(tf.float32),
		}
		```
		
		Then the output is a dictionary:
		
		```python
		{
		  "kw": SparseTensor(
		      indices=[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0]],
		      values=["knit", "big", "emmy"]
		      dense_shape=[2, 2]),
		  "dank": SparseTensor(
		      indices=[[1, 0]],

		      dense_shape=[2, 1]),
		  "gps": SparseTensor(
		      indices=[],
		      values=[],
		      dense_shape=[2, 0]),
		}
		```
		
		For dense results in two serialized `Example`s:
		
		```
		[
		  features {
		    feature { key: "age" value { int64_list { value: [ 0 ] } } }
		    feature { key: "gender" value { bytes_list { value: [ "f" ] } } }
		   },
		   features {

		    feature { key: "gender" value { bytes_list { value: [ "f" ] } } }
		  }
		]
		```
		
		We can use arguments:
		
		```
		example_names: ["input0", "input1"],
		features: {
		    "age": FixedLenFeature([], dtype=tf.int64, default_value=-1),
		    "gender": FixedLenFeature([], dtype=tf.string),
		}
		```
		
		And the expected output is:
		
		```python
		{
		  "age": [[0], [-1]],
		  "gender": [["f"], ["f"]],
		}
		```
		
		An alternative to `VarLenFeature` to obtain a `SparseTensor` is
		`SparseFeature`. For example, given two `Example` input protos in
		`serialized`:
		
		```
		[
		  features {
		    feature { key: "val" value { float_list { value: [ 0.5, -1.0 ] } } }
		    feature { key: "ix" value { int64_list { value: [ 3, 20 ] } } }
		  },
		  features {
		    feature { key: "val" value { float_list { value: [ 0.0 ] } } }
		    feature { key: "ix" value { int64_list { value: [ 42 ] } } }
		  }
		]
		```
		
		And arguments
		
		```
		example_names: ["input0", "input1"],
		features: {
		    "sparse": SparseFeature(
		        index_key="ix", value_key="val", dtype=tf.float32, size=100),
		}
		```
		
		Then the output is a dictionary:

		Parses a single `SequenceExample` proto.
		
		Parses a single serialized [`SequenceExample`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/example/example.proto)
		proto given in `serialized`.
		
		This op parses a serialized sequence example into a tuple of dictionaries
		mapping keys to `Tensor` and `SparseTensor` objects respectively.
		The first dictionary contains mappings for keys appearing in
		`context_features`, and the second dictionary contains mappings for keys
		appearing in `sequence_features`.
		
		At least one of `context_features` and `sequence_features` must be provided
		and non-empty.
		
		The `context_features` keys are associated with a `SequenceExample` as a
		whole, independent of time / frame.  In contrast, the `sequence_features` keys
		provide a way to access variable-length data within the `FeatureList` section
		of the `SequenceExample` proto.  While the shapes of `context_features` values
		are fixed with respect to frame, the frame dimension (the first dimension)
		of `sequence_features` values may vary between `SequenceExample` protos,
		and even between `feature_list` keys within the same `SequenceExample`.
		
		`context_features` contains `VarLenFeature` and `FixedLenFeature` objects.
		Each `VarLenFeature` is mapped to a `SparseTensor`, and each `FixedLenFeature`
		is mapped to a `Tensor`, of the specified type, shape, and default value.
		
		`sequence_features` contains `VarLenFeature` and `FixedLenSequenceFeature`
		objects. Each `VarLenFeature` is mapped to a `SparseTensor`, and each
		`FixedLenSequenceFeature` is mapped to a `Tensor`, each of the specified type.
		The shape will be `(T,) + df.dense_shape` for `FixedLenSequenceFeature` `df`, where
		`T` is the length of the associated `FeatureList` in the `SequenceExample`.
		For instance, `FixedLenSequenceFeature([])` yields a scalar 1-D `Tensor` of
		static shape `[None]` and dynamic shape `[T]`, while
		`FixedLenSequenceFeature([k])` (for `int k >= 1`) yields a 2-D matrix `Tensor`
		of static shape `[None, k]` and dynamic shape `[T, k]`.
		
		Each `SparseTensor` corresponding to `sequence_features` represents a ragged
		vector.  Its indices are `[time, index]`, where `time` is the `FeatureList`
		entry and `index` is the value's index in the list of values associated with
		that time.
		
		`FixedLenFeature` entries with a `default_value` and `FixedLenSequenceFeature`
		entries with `allow_missing=True` are optional; otherwise, we will fail if
		that `Feature` or `FeatureList` is missing from any example in `serialized`.
		
		`example_name` may contain a descriptive name for the corresponding serialized
		proto. This may be useful for debugging purposes, but it has no effect on the
		output. If not `None`, `example_name` must be a scalar.
		
		Args:
		  serialized: A scalar (0-D Tensor) of type string, a single binary
		    serialized `SequenceExample` proto.
		  context_features: A `dict` mapping feature keys to `FixedLenFeature` or

		    `SequenceExample` as a whole.

		    Important Note: Input and output numpy `ndarray`s of `func` are not

		Quantize the 'input' tensor of type float to 'output' tensor of type 'T'.
		
		[min_range, max_range] are scalar floats that specify the range for
		the 'input' data. The 'mode' attribute controls exactly which calculations are
		used to convert the float values to their quantized equivalents.  The
		'round_mode' attribute controls which rounding tie-breaking algorithm is used
		when rounding float values to their quantized equivalents.
		
		In 'MIN_COMBINED' mode, each value of the tensor will undergo the following:
		
		```
		out[i] = (in[i] - min_range) * range(T) / (max_range - min_range)
		if T == qint8, out[i] -= (range(T) + 1) / 2.0
		```
		
		here `range(T) = numeric_limits<T>::max() - numeric_limits<T>::min()`
		
		*MIN_COMBINED Mode Example*
		
		Assume the input is type float and has a possible range of [0.0, 6.0] and the
		output type is quint8 ([0, 255]). The min_range and max_range values should be
		specified as 0.0 and 6.0. Quantizing from float to quint8 will multiply each
		value of the input by 255/6 and cast to quint8.
		
		If the output type was qint8 ([-128, 127]), the operation will additionally
		subtract each value by 128 prior to casting, so that the range of values aligns
		with the range of qint8.
		
		If the mode is 'MIN_FIRST', then this approach is used:
		
		```
		num_discrete_values = 1 << (# of bits in T)
		range_adjust = num_discrete_values / (num_discrete_values - 1)
		range = (range_max - range_min) * range_adjust
		range_scale = num_discrete_values / range
		quantized = round(input * range_scale) - round(range_min * range_scale) +
		  numeric_limits<T>::min()
		quantized = max(quantized, numeric_limits<T>::min())
		quantized = min(quantized, numeric_limits<T>::max())
		```
		
		The biggest difference between this and MIN_COMBINED is that the minimum range
		is rounded first, before it's subtracted from the rounded value. With
		MIN_COMBINED, a small bias is introduced where repeated iterations of quantizing
		and dequantizing will introduce a larger and larger error.
		
		*SCALED mode Example*
		
		`SCALED` mode matches the quantization approach used in
		`QuantizeAndDequantize{V2|V3}`.
		
		If the mode is `SCALED`, we do not use the full range of the output type,
		choosing to elide the lowest possible value for symmetry (e.g., output range is
		-127 to 127, not -128 to 127 for signed 8 bit quantization), so that 0.0 maps to
		0.
		
		We first find the range of values in our tensor. The
		range we use is always centered on 0, so we find m such that
		
		```c++
		  m = max(abs(input_min), abs(input_max))
		```
		
		Our input tensor range is then `[-m, m]`.
		
		Next, we choose our fixed-point quantization buckets, `[min_fixed, max_fixed]`.
		If T is signed, this is
		
		```
		  num_bits = sizeof(T) * 8
		  [min_fixed, max_fixed] =
		      [-(1 << (num_bits - 1) - 1), (1 << (num_bits - 1)) - 1]
		```
		
		Otherwise, if T is unsigned, the fixed-point range is
		
		```
		  [min_fixed, max_fixed] = [0, (1 << num_bits) - 1]
		```
		
		From this we compute our scaling factor, s:
		
		```c++
		  s = (max_fixed - min_fixed) / (2 * m)
		```
		
		Now we can quantize the elements of our tensor:
		
		```c++

		One thing to watch out for is that the operator may choose to adjust the
		requested minimum and maximum values slightly during the quantization process,
		so you should always use the output ports as the range for further calculations.
		For example, if the requested minimum and maximum values are close to equal,
		they will be separated by a small epsilon value to prevent ill-formed quantized
		buffers from being created. Otherwise, you can end up with buffers where all the
		quantized values map to the same float value, which causes problems for
		operations that have to perform further calculations on them.

		scan on the list of tensors unpacked from `elems` on dimension 0.
		
		The simplest version of `scan` repeatedly applies the callable `fn` to a
		sequence of elements from first to last. The elements are made of the tensors
		unpacked from `elems` on dimension 0. The callable fn takes two tensors as
		arguments. The first argument is the accumulated value computed from the
		preceding invocation of fn. If `initializer` is None, `elems` must contain
		at least one element, and its first element is used as the initializer.
		
		Suppose that `elems` is unpacked into `values`, a list of tensors. The shape
		of the result tensor is `[len(values)] + fn(initializer, values[0]).shape`.
		If reverse=True, it's fn(initializer, values[-1]).shape.
		
		This method also allows multi-arity `elems` and accumulator.  If `elems`
		is a (possibly nested) list or tuple of tensors, then each of these tensors
		must have a matching first (unpack) dimension.  The second argument of
		`fn` must match the structure of `elems`.
		
		If no `initializer` is provided, the output structure and dtypes of `fn`
		are assumed to be the same as its input; and in this case, the first
		argument of `fn` must match the structure of `elems`.
		
		If an `initializer` is provided, then the output of `fn` must have the same
		structure as `initializer`; and the first argument of `fn` must match
		this structure.
		
		For example, if `elems` is `(t1, [t2, t3])` and `initializer` is
		`[i1, i2]` then an appropriate signature for `fn` in `python2` is:
		`fn = lambda (acc_p1, acc_p2), (t1, [t2, t3]):` and `fn` must return a list,
		`[acc_n1, acc_n2]`.  An alternative correct signature for `fn`, and the
		 one that works in `python3`, is:
		`fn = lambda a, t:`, where `a` and `t` correspond to the input tuples.
		
		Args:
		  fn: The callable to be performed.  It accepts two arguments.  The first
		    will have the same structure as `initializer` if one is provided,
		    otherwise it will have the same structure as `elems`.  The second
		    will have the same (possibly nested) structure as `elems`.  Its output
		    must have the same structure as `initializer` if one is provided,
		    otherwise it must have the same structure as `elems`.
		  elems: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, each of which
		    will be unpacked along their first dimension.  The nested sequence
		    of the resulting slices will be the first argument to `fn`.
		  initializer: (optional) A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors,
		    initial value for the accumulator, and the expected output type of `fn`.
		  parallel_iterations: (optional) The number of iterations allowed to run
		    in parallel.
		  back_prop: (optional) True enables support for back propagation.
		  swap_memory: (optional) True enables GPU-CPU memory swapping.
		  infer_shape: (optional) False disables tests for consistent output shapes.
		  reverse: (optional) True scans the tensor last to first (instead of first
		    to last).
		  name: (optional) Name prefix for the returned tensors.
		
		Returns:
		  A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors.  Each tensor packs the
		  results of applying `fn` to tensors unpacked from `elems` along the first
		  dimension, and the previous accumulator value(s), from first to last (or
		  last to first, if `reverse=True`).
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: if `fn` is not callable or the structure of the output of
		    `fn` and `initializer` do not match.
		  ValueError: if the lengths of the output of `fn` and `initializer`
		    do not match.
		
		Examples:
		  ```python
		  elems = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
		  sum = scan(lambda a, x: a + x, elems)
		  # sum == [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21]

		Scatter `updates` into a new tensor according to `indices`.
		
		Creates a new tensor by applying sparse `updates` to individual values or
		slices within a tensor (initially zero for numeric, empty for string) of
		the given `shape` according to indices.  This operator is the inverse of the
		`tf.gather_nd` operator which extracts values or slices from a given tensor.
		
		If `indices` contains duplicates, then their updates are accumulated (summed).
		
		**WARNING**: The order in which updates are applied is nondeterministic, so the
		output will be nondeterministic if `indices` contains duplicates -- because
		of some numerical approximation issues, numbers summed in different order
		may yield different results.
		
		`indices` is an integer tensor containing indices into a new tensor of shape
		`shape`.  The last dimension of `indices` can be at most the rank of `shape`:
		
		    indices.shape[-1] <= shape.rank
		
		The last dimension of `indices` corresponds to indices into elements
		(if `indices.shape[-1] = shape.rank`) or slices
		(if `indices.shape[-1] < shape.rank`) along dimension `indices.shape[-1]` of
		`shape`.  `updates` is a tensor with shape
		
		    indices.shape[:-1] + shape[indices.shape[-1]:]
		
		The simplest form of scatter is to insert individual elements in a tensor by
		index. For example, say we want to insert 4 scattered elements in a rank-1
		tensor with 8 elements.

		Sets the graph-level random seed.
		
		Operations that rely on a random seed actually derive it from two seeds:
		the graph-level and operation-level seeds. This sets the graph-level seed.
		
		Its interactions with operation-level seeds is as follows:
		
		  1. If neither the graph-level nor the operation seed is set:
		    A random seed is used for this op.
		  2. If the graph-level seed is set, but the operation seed is not:
		    The system deterministically picks an operation seed in conjunction
		    with the graph-level seed so that it gets a unique random sequence.
		  3. If the graph-level seed is not set, but the operation seed is set:
		    A default graph-level seed and the specified operation seed are used to
		    determine the random sequence.
		  4. If both the graph-level and the operation seed are set:
		    Both seeds are used in conjunction to determine the random sequence.
		
		To illustrate the user-visible effects, consider these examples:
		
		To generate different sequences across sessions, set neither
		graph-level nor op-level seeds:
		
		```python
		a = tf.random_uniform([1])
		b = tf.random_normal([1])
		
		print("Session 1")
		with tf.Session() as sess1:
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A1'
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A2'
		  print(sess1.run(b))  # generates 'B1'
		  print(sess1.run(b))  # generates 'B2'
		
		print("Session 2")
		with tf.Session() as sess2:
		  print(sess2.run(a))  # generates 'A3'
		  print(sess2.run(a))  # generates 'A4'
		  print(sess2.run(b))  # generates 'B3'
		  print(sess2.run(b))  # generates 'B4'
		```
		
		To generate the same repeatable sequence for an op across sessions, set the
		seed for the op:
		
		```python
		a = tf.random_uniform([1], seed=1)
		b = tf.random_normal([1])
		
		# Repeatedly running this block with the same graph will generate the same
		# sequence of values for 'a', but different sequences of values for 'b'.
		print("Session 1")
		with tf.Session() as sess1:
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A1'
		  print(sess1.run(a))  # generates 'A2'
		  print(sess1.run(b))  # generates 'B1'
		  print(sess1.run(b))  # generates 'B2'
		
		print("Session 2")
		with tf.Session() as sess2:
		  print(sess2.run(a))  # generates 'A1'
		  print(sess2.run(a))  # generates 'A2'
		  print(sess2.run(b))  # generates 'B3'
		  print(sess2.run(b))  # generates 'B4'
		```
		
		To make the random sequences generated by all ops be repeatable across
		sessions, set a graph-level seed:
		
		```python
		tf.set_random_seed(1234)
		a = tf.random_uniform([1])
		b = tf.random_normal([1])
		
		# Repeatedly running this block with the same graph will generate the same

		SpaceToBatch for N-D tensors of type T.
		
		This operation divides "spatial" dimensions `[1, ..., M]` of the input into a

		`[1, ..., M]` correspond to the position within the grid, and the batch

		          block_shape[M-1]] +
		         remaining_shape
		
		    3. Permute dimensions of `reshaped_padded` to produce

		SpaceToDepth for tensors of type T.
		
		Rearranges blocks of spatial data, into depth. More specifically,
		this op outputs a copy of the input tensor where values from the `height`
		and `width` dimensions are moved to the `depth` dimension.
		The attr `block_size` indicates the input block size.
		
		  * Non-overlapping blocks of size `block_size x block size` are rearranged
		    into depth at each location.
		  * The depth of the output tensor is `block_size * block_size * input_depth`.
		  * The Y, X coordinates within each block of the input become the high order
		    component of the output channel index.
		  * The input tensor's height and width must be divisible by block_size.
		
		The `data_format` attr specifies the layout of the input and output tensors
		with the following options:
		  "NHWC": `[ batch, height, width, channels ]`
		  "NCHW": `[ batch, channels, height, width ]`
		  "NCHW_VECT_C":
		      `qint8 [ batch, channels / 4, height, width, 4 ]`
		
		It is useful to consider the operation as transforming a 6-D Tensor.
		e.g. for data_format = NHWC,
		     Each element in the input tensor can be specified via 6 coordinates,
		     ordered by decreasing memory layout significance as:
		     n,oY,bY,oX,bX,iC  (where n=batch index, oX, oY means X or Y coordinates
		                        within the output image, bX, bY means coordinates
		                        within the input block, iC means input channels).
		     The output would be a transpose to the following layout:
		     n,oY,oX,bY,bX,iC
		
		This operation is useful for resizing the activations between convolutions
		(but keeping all data), e.g. instead of pooling. It is also useful for training
		purely convolutional models.
		
		For example, given an input of shape `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, data_format = "NHWC" and
		block_size = 2:
		
		```
		x = [[[[1], [2]],
		      [[3], [4]]]]
		```
		
		This operation will output a tensor of shape `[1, 1, 1, 4]`:
		
		```
		[[[[1, 2, 3, 4]]]]
		```
		
		Here, the input has a batch of 1 and each batch element has shape `[2, 2, 1]`,
		the corresponding output will have a single element (i.e. width and height are
		both 1) and will have a depth of 4 channels (1 * block_size * block_size).
		The output element shape is `[1, 1, 4]`.
		
		For an input tensor with larger depth, here of shape `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, e.g.
		
		```
		x = [[[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],
		      [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]]]
		```
		
		This operation, for block_size of 2, will return the following tensor of shape
		`[1, 1, 1, 12]`
		
		```
		[[[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]]]]
		```
		
		Similarly, for the following input of shape `[1 4 4 1]`, and a block size of 2:
		
		```
		x = [[[[1],   [2],  [5],  [6]],
		      [[3],   [4],  [7],  [8]],
		      [[9],  [10], [13],  [14]],
		      [[11], [12], [15],  [16]]]]
		```
		
		the operator will return the following tensor of shape `[1 2 2 4]`:
		
		```
		x = [[[[1, 2, 3, 4],
		       [5, 6, 7, 8]],
		      [[9, 10, 11, 12],

		of arguments does not matter.  Use vanilla `tf.add()` for adding two dense
		`Tensor`s.
		
		The shapes of the two operands must match: broadcasting is not supported.
		
		The indices of any input `SparseTensor` are assumed ordered in standard

		`SparseReorder` to restore index ordering.
		
		If both arguments are sparse, we perform "clipping" as follows.  By default,

		include that particular location in its index, storing a zero in the
		corresponding value slot.  To override this, callers can specify `thresh`,
		indicating that if the sum has a magnitude strictly smaller than `thresh`, its
		corresponding value and index would then not be included.  In particular,
		`thresh == 0.0` (default) means everything is kept and actual thresholding

		Concatenation is with respect to the dense versions of each sparse input.
		It is assumed that each inputs is a `SparseTensor` whose elements are ordered
		along increasing dimension number.
		
		If expand_nonconcat_dim is False, all inputs' shapes must match, except for

		The `indices`, `values`, and `shapes` lists must have the same length.
		
		If expand_nonconcat_dim is False, then the output shape is identical to the

		sizes along that dimension.
		
		If expand_nonconcat_dim is True, then the output shape along the non-concat

		The output elements will be resorted to preserve the sort order along
		increasing dimension number.
		
		This op runs in `O(M log M)` time, where `M` is the total number of non-empty

		Combines a batch of feature ids and values into a single `SparseTensor`.
		
		The most common use case for this function occurs when feature ids and
		their corresponding values are stored in `Example` protos on disk.
		`parse_example` will return a batch of ids and a batch of values, and this
		function joins them into a single logical `SparseTensor` for use in
		functions such as `sparse_tensor_dense_matmul`, `sparse_to_dense`, etc.
		
		The `SparseTensor` returned by this function has the following properties:
		
		  - `indices` is equivalent to `sp_ids.indices` with the last
		    dimension discarded and replaced with `sp_ids.values`.
		  - `values` is simply `sp_values.values`.
		  - If `sp_ids.dense_shape = [D0, D1, ..., Dn, K]`, then
		    `output.shape = [D0, D1, ..., Dn, vocab_size]`.
		
		For example, consider the following feature vectors:
		
		```python
		  vector1 = [-3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
		  vector2 = [ 0, 1, 0, 4, 1, 0]
		  vector3 = [ 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
		```
		
		These might be stored sparsely in the following Example protos by storing
		only the feature ids (column number if the vectors are treated as a matrix)
		of the non-zero elements and the corresponding values:
		
		```python
		  examples = [Example(features={
		                  "ids": Feature(int64_list=Int64List(value=[0])),
		                  "values": Feature(float_list=FloatList(value=[-3]))}),
		              Example(features={
		                  "ids": Feature(int64_list=Int64List(value=[1, 4, 3])),
		                  "values": Feature(float_list=FloatList(value=[1, 1, 4]))}),
		              Example(features={
		                  "ids": Feature(int64_list=Int64List(value=[0, 3])),
		                  "values": Feature(float_list=FloatList(value=[5, 9]))})]
		```
		
		The result of calling parse_example on these examples will produce a
		dictionary with entries for "ids" and "values". Passing those two objects
		to this function along with vocab_size=6, will produce a `SparseTensor` that
		sparsely represents all three instances. Namely, the `indices` property will
		contain the coordinates of the non-zero entries in the feature matrix (the
		first dimension is the row number in the matrix, i.e., the index within the
		batch, and the second dimension is the column number, i.e., the feature id);
		`values` will contain the actual values. `shape` will be the shape of the
		original matrix, i.e., (3, 6). For our example above, the output will be
		equal to:
		
		```python
		  SparseTensor(indices=[[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 0], [2, 3]],
		               values=[-3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9],
		               dense_shape=[3, 6])
		```
		
		This method generalizes to higher-dimensions by simply providing a list for
		both the sp_ids as well as the vocab_size.
		In this case the resulting `SparseTensor` has the following properties:
		  - `indices` is equivalent to `sp_ids[0].indices` with the last
		    dimension discarded and concatenated with
		    `sp_ids[0].values, sp_ids[1].values, ...`.
		  - `values` is simply `sp_values.values`.
		  - If `sp_ids.dense_shape = [D0, D1, ..., Dn, K]`, then
		    `output.shape = [D0, D1, ..., Dn] + vocab_size`.

		    or `int64` or a Python list of such `SparseTensor`s or a list thereof.

		  vocab_size: A scalar `int64` Tensor (or Python int) containing the new size
		    of the last dimension, `all(0 <= sp_ids.values < vocab_size)`.

		For example if dense form of your sparse data has shape `[3, 5]` and values:
		
		    [[  a      ]
		     [b       c]
		     [    d    ]]
		
		
		`SparseTensor` format expected by `sparse_tensor_dense_matmul`:
		 `sp_a` (indices, values):
		
		    [0, 1]: a
		    [1, 0]: b
		    [1, 4]: c
		    [2, 2]: d
		
		`SparseTensor` format expected by `embedding_lookup_sparse`:
		 `sp_ids`                 `sp_weights`
		
		    [0, 0]: 1                [0, 0]: a
		    [1, 0]: 0                [1, 0]: b
		    [1, 1]: 4                [1, 1]: c
		    [2, 0]: 2                [2, 0]: d
		
		
		Deciding when to use `sparse_tensor_dense_matmul` vs.
		`matmul`(a_is_sparse=True):
		
		There are a number of questions to ask in the decision process, including:
		
		* Will the SparseTensor `A` fit in memory if densified?
		* Is the column count of the product large (>> 1)?
		* Is the density of `A` larger than approximately 15%?
		
		If the answer to several of these questions is yes, consider
		converting the `SparseTensor` to a dense one and using `tf.matmul` with
		`a_is_sparse=True`.
		
		This operation tends to perform well when `A` is more sparse, if the column
		size of the product is small (e.g. matrix-vector multiplication), if
		`sp_a.dense_shape` takes on large values.
		
		Below is a rough speed comparison between `sparse_tensor_dense_matmul`,
		labeled 'sparse', and `matmul`(a_is_sparse=True), labeled 'dense'.  For
		purposes of the comparison, the time spent converting from a `SparseTensor` to
		a dense `Tensor` is not included, so it is overly conservative with respect to
		the time ratio.

		Extracts a strided slice of a tensor (generalized python array indexing).
		
		**Instead of calling this op directly most users will want to use the
		NumPy-style slicing syntax (e.g. `tensor[..., 3:4:-1, tf.newaxis, 3]`), which
		is supported via `tf.Tensor.__getitem__` and `tf.Variable.__getitem__`.**
		The interface of this op is a low-level encoding of the slicing syntax.
		
		Roughly speaking, this op extracts a slice of size `(end-begin)/stride`
		from the given `input_` tensor. Starting at the location specified by `begin`
		the slice continues by adding `stride` to the index until all dimensions are
		not less than `end`.
		Note that a stride can be negative, which causes a reverse slice.
		
		Given a Python slice `input[spec0, spec1, ..., specn]`,
		this function will be called as follows.
		
		`begin`, `end`, and `strides` will be vectors of length n.
		n in general is not equal to the rank of the `input_` tensor.
		
		In each mask field (`begin_mask`, `end_mask`, `ellipsis_mask`,
		`new_axis_mask`, `shrink_axis_mask`) the ith bit will correspond to
		the ith spec.
		
		If the ith bit of `begin_mask` is set, `begin[i]` is ignored and
		the fullest possible range in that dimension is used instead.
		`end_mask` works analogously, except with the end range.
		
		`foo[5:,:,:3]` on a 7x8x9 tensor is equivalent to `foo[5:7,0:8,0:3]`.
		`foo[::-1]` reverses a tensor with shape 8.
		
		If the ith bit of `ellipsis_mask` is set, as many unspecified dimensions
		as needed will be inserted between other dimensions. Only one
		non-zero bit is allowed in `ellipsis_mask`.
		
		For example `foo[3:5,...,4:5]` on a shape 10x3x3x10 tensor is
		equivalent to `foo[3:5,:,:,4:5]` and
		`foo[3:5,...]` is equivalent to `foo[3:5,:,:,:]`.
		
		If the ith bit of `new_axis_mask` is set, then `begin`,
		`end`, and `stride` are ignored and a new length 1 dimension is
		added at this point in the output tensor.
		
		For example,
		`foo[:4, tf.newaxis, :2]` would produce a shape `(4, 1, 2)` tensor.
		
		If the ith bit of `shrink_axis_mask` is set, it implies that the ith
		specification shrinks the dimensionality by 1, taking on the value at index
		`begin[i]`. `end[i]` and `strides[i]` are ignored in this case. For example in
		Python one might do `foo[:, 3, :]` which would result in `shrink_axis_mask`
		equal to 2.
		
		
		NOTE: `begin` and `end` are zero-indexed.
		`strides` entries must be non-zero.

		Tensor contraction of a and b along specified axes.
		
		Tensordot (also known as tensor contraction) sums the product of elements
		from `a` and `b` over the indices specified by `a_axes` and `b_axes`.
		The lists `a_axes` and `b_axes` specify those pairs of axes along which to
		contract the tensors. The axis `a_axes[i]` of `a` must have the same dimension
		as axis `b_axes[i]` of `b` for all `i` in `range(0, len(a_axes))`. The lists
		`a_axes` and `b_axes` must have identical length and consist of unique
		integers that specify valid axes for each of the tensors.
		
		This operation corresponds to `numpy.tensordot(a, b, axes)`.
		
		Example 1: When `a` and `b` are matrices (order 2), the case `axes = 1`
		is equivalent to matrix multiplication.
		
		Example 2: When `a` and `b` are matrices (order 2), the case
		`axes = [[1], [0]]` is equivalent to matrix multiplication.

		\\(c_{jklm}\\) whose entry
		corresponding to the indices \\((j,k,l,m)\\) is given by:
		
		\\( c_{jklm} = \sum_i a_{ijk} b_{lmi} \\).
		
		In general, `order(c) = order(a) + order(b) - 2*len(axes[0])`.
		
		Args:
		  a: `Tensor` of type `float32` or `float64`.
		  b: `Tensor` with the same type as `a`.

		Scope which defines a variable creation function to be used by variable().
		
		variable_creator is expected to be a function with the following signature:
		
		```
		  def variable_creator(next_creator, **kwargs)
		```
		
		The creator is supposed to eventually call the next_creator to create a
		variable if it does want to create a variable and not call Variable or
		ResourceVariable directly. This helps make creators composable. A creator may
		choose to create multiple variables, return already existing variables, or
		simply register that a variable was created and defer to the next creators in
		line. Creators can also modify the keyword arguments seen by the next
		creators.
		
		Custom getters in the variable scope will eventually resolve down to these
		custom creators when they do create variables.
		
		The valid keyword arguments in kwds are:
		    initial_value: A `Tensor`, or Python object convertible to a `Tensor`,
		      which is the initial value for the Variable. The initial value must have
		      a shape specified unless `validate_shape` is set to False. Can also be a
		      callable with no argument that returns the initial value when called. In
		      that case, `dtype` must be specified. (Note that initializer functions
		      from init_ops.py must first be bound to a shape before being used here.)
		    trainable: If `True`, the default, also adds the variable to the graph
		      collection `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`. This collection is used as
		      the default list of variables to use by the `Optimizer` classes.
		      `trainable` defaults to `True` unless `synchronization` is
		      set to `ON_READ`.
		    collections: List of graph collections keys. The new variable is added to
		      these collections. Defaults to `[GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES]`.
		    validate_shape: If `False`, allows the variable to be initialized with a
		      value of unknown shape. If `True`, the default, the shape of
		      `initial_value` must be known.
		    caching_device: Optional device string describing where the Variable
		      should be cached for reading.  Defaults to the Variable's device.
		      If not `None`, caches on another device.  Typical use is to cache
		      on the device where the Ops using the Variable reside, to deduplicate
		      copying through `Switch` and other conditional statements.
		    name: Optional name for the variable. Defaults to `'Variable'` and gets
		      uniquified automatically.
		    dtype: If set, initial_value will be converted to the given type.
		      If `None`, either the datatype will be kept (if `initial_value` is
		      a Tensor), or `convert_to_tensor` will decide.
		    constraint: A constraint function to be applied to the variable after
		      updates by some algorithms.
		    use_resource: if True, a ResourceVariable is always created.
		    synchronization: Indicates when a distributed a variable will be
		      aggregated. Accepted values are constants defined in the class
		      `tf.VariableSynchronization`. By default the synchronization is set to
		      `AUTO` and the current `DistributionStrategy` chooses
		      when to synchronize. If `synchronization` is set to `ON_READ`,
		      `trainable` must not be set to `True`.
		    aggregation: Indicates how a distributed variable will be aggregated.
		      Accepted values are constants defined in the class
		      `tf.VariableAggregation`.
		
		This set may grow over time, so it's important the signature of creators is as
		mentioned above.

		Repeat `body` while the condition `cond` is true.
		
		`cond` is a callable returning a boolean scalar tensor. `body` is a callable
		returning a (possibly nested) tuple, namedtuple or list of tensors of the same
		arity (length and structure) and types as `loop_vars`. `loop_vars` is a
		(possibly nested) tuple, namedtuple or list of tensors that is passed to both
		`cond` and `body`. `cond` and `body` both take as many arguments as there are
		`loop_vars`.
		
		In addition to regular Tensors or IndexedSlices, the body may accept and
		return TensorArray objects.  The flows of the TensorArray objects will
		be appropriately forwarded between loops and during gradient calculations.
		
		Note that `while_loop` calls `cond` and `body` *exactly once* (inside the
		call to `while_loop`, and not at all during `Session.run()`). `while_loop`
		stitches together the graph fragments created during the `cond` and `body`
		calls with some additional graph nodes to create the graph flow that
		repeats `body` until `cond` returns false.
		
		For correctness, `tf.while_loop()` strictly enforces shape invariants for
		the loop variables. A shape invariant is a (possibly partial) shape that
		is unchanged across the iterations of the loop. An error will be raised
		if the shape of a loop variable after an iteration is determined to be more
		general than or incompatible with its shape invariant. For example, a shape
		of [11, None] is more general than a shape of [11, 17], and [11, 21] is not
		compatible with [11, 17]. By default (if the argument `shape_invariants` is
		not specified), it is assumed that the initial shape of each tensor in
		`loop_vars` is the same in every iteration. The `shape_invariants` argument
		allows the caller to specify a less specific shape invariant for each loop
		variable, which is needed if the shape varies between iterations. The
		`tf.Tensor.set_shape`
		function may also be used in the `body` function to indicate that
		the output loop variable has a particular shape. The shape invariant for
		SparseTensor and IndexedSlices are treated specially as follows:
		
		a) If a loop variable is a SparseTensor, the shape invariant must be
		TensorShape([r]) where r is the rank of the dense tensor represented
		by the sparse tensor. It means the shapes of the three tensors of the
		SparseTensor are ([None], [None, r], [r]). NOTE: The shape invariant here
		is the shape of the SparseTensor.dense_shape property. It must be the shape of
		a vector.
		
		b) If a loop variable is an IndexedSlices, the shape invariant must be
		a shape invariant of the values tensor of the IndexedSlices. It means
		the shapes of the three tensors of the IndexedSlices are (shape, [shape[0]],
		[shape.ndims]).
		
		`while_loop` implements non-strict semantics, enabling multiple iterations
		to run in parallel. The maximum number of parallel iterations can be
		controlled by `parallel_iterations`, which gives users some control over
		memory consumption and execution order. For correct programs, `while_loop`
		should return the same result for any parallel_iterations > 0.
		
		For training, TensorFlow stores the tensors that are produced in the
		forward inference and are needed in back propagation. These tensors are a
		main source of memory consumption and often cause OOM errors when training
		on GPUs. When the flag swap_memory is true, we swap out these tensors from
		GPU to CPU. This for example allows us to train RNN models with very long
		sequences and large batches.
		
		Args:
		  cond: A callable that represents the termination condition of the loop.
		  body: A callable that represents the loop body.
		  loop_vars: A (possibly nested) tuple, namedtuple or list of numpy array,
		    `Tensor`, and `TensorArray` objects.
		  shape_invariants: The shape invariants for the loop variables.
		  parallel_iterations: The number of iterations allowed to run in parallel.
		    It must be a positive integer.
		  back_prop: Whether backprop is enabled for this while loop.
		  swap_memory: Whether GPU-CPU memory swap is enabled for this loop.
		  name: Optional name prefix for the returned tensors.
		  maximum_iterations: Optional maximum number of iterations of the while loop
		    to run.  If provided, the `cond` output is AND-ed with an additional
		    condition ensuring the number of iterations executed is no greater than
		    `maximum_iterations`.
		  return_same_structure: If True, output has same structure as `loop_vars`. If
		    eager execution is enabled, this is ignored (and always treated as True).
		
		Returns:
		  The output tensors for the loop variables after the loop.
		   If `return_same_structure` is True, the return value has the same
		   structure as `loop_vars`.
		   If `return_same_structure` is False, the return value is a Tensor,
		   TensorArray or IndexedSlice if the length of `loop_vars` is 1, or a list
		   otherwise.
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: if `cond` or `body` is not callable.
		  ValueError: if `loop_vars` is empty.
		
		Example:
		
		```python
		i = tf.constant(0)
		c = lambda i: tf.less(i, 10)
		b = lambda i: tf.add(i, 1)
		r = tf.while_loop(c, b, [i])
		```
		
		Example with nesting and a namedtuple:
		
		```python
		import collections
		Pair = collections.namedtuple('Pair', 'j, k')
		ijk_0 = (tf.constant(0), Pair(tf.constant(1), tf.constant(2)))
		c = lambda i, p: i < 10
		b = lambda i, p: (i + 1, Pair((p.j + p.k), (p.j - p.k)))
		ijk_final = tf.while_loop(c, b, ijk_0)
		```
		
		Example using shape_invariants:
		
		```python
		i0 = tf.constant(0)
		m0 = tf.ones([2, 2])
		c = lambda i, m: i < 10
		b = lambda i, m: [i+1, tf.concat([m, m], axis=0)]
		tf.while_loop(
		    c, b, loop_vars=[i0, m0],
		    shape_invariants=[i0.get_shape(), tf.TensorShape([None, 2])])
		```
		
		Example which demonstrates non-strict semantics: In the following
		example, the final value of the counter `i` does not depend on `x`. So
		the `while_loop` can increment the counter parallel to updates of `x`.
		However, because the loop counter at one loop iteration depends
		on the value at the previous iteration, the loop counter itself cannot
		be incremented in parallel. Hence if we just want the final value of the
		counter (which we print on the line `print(sess.run(i))`), then
		`x` will never be incremented, but the counter will be updated on a
		single thread. Conversely, if we want the value of the output (which we
		print on the line `print(sess.run(out).shape)`), then the counter may be
		incremented on its own thread, while `x` can be incremented in
		parallel on a separate thread. In the extreme case, it is conceivable
		that the thread incrementing the counter runs until completion before
		`x` is incremented even a single time. The only thing that can never
		happen is that the thread updating `x` can never get ahead of the
		counter thread because the thread incrementing `x` depends on the value
		of the counter.
		
		```python
		import tensorflow as tf
		
		n = 10000
		x = tf.constant(list(range(n)))
		c = lambda i, x: i < n
		b = lambda i, x: (tf.Print(i + 1, [i]), tf.Print(x + 1, [i], "x:"))
		i, out = tf.while_loop(c, b, (0, x))
		with tf.Session() as sess:
		    print(sess.run(i))  # prints [0] ... [9999]
		
		    # The following line may increment the counter and x in parallel.
		    # The counter thread may get ahead of the other thread, but not the
		    # other way around. So you may see things like
		    # [9996] x:[9987]
		    # meaning that the counter thread is on iteration 9996,
		    # while the other thread is on iteration 9987
		    print(sess.run(out).shape)
		```
