		        See `tf.losses`. If the model has multiple outputs, you can use a

		        Typically you will use `metrics=['accuracy']`.

		    sample_weight_mode: If you need to do timestep-wise

	/**
		Fits the model on data yielded batch-by-batch by a Python generator.
		
		The generator is run in parallel to the model, for efficiency.
		For instance, this allows you to do real-time data augmentation
		on images on CPU in parallel to training your model on GPU.
		
		The use of `keras.utils.Sequence` guarantees the ordering
		and guarantees the single use of every input per epoch when
		using `use_multiprocessing=True`.
		
		Arguments:
		    generator: A generator or an instance of `Sequence`
		      (`keras.utils.Sequence`)
		        object in order to avoid duplicate data
		        when using multiprocessing.
		        The output of the generator must be either
		        - a tuple `(inputs, targets)`
		        - a tuple `(inputs, targets, sample_weights)`.
		        This tuple (a single output of the generator) makes a single batch.
		        Therefore, all arrays in this tuple must have the same length (equal
		        to the size of this batch). Different batches may have different
		          sizes.
		        For example, the last batch of the epoch is commonly smaller than
		          the
		        others, if the size of the dataset is not divisible by the batch
		          size.
		        The generator is expected to loop over its data
		        indefinitely. An epoch finishes when `steps_per_epoch`
		        batches have been seen by the model.
		    steps_per_epoch: Total number of steps (batches of samples)
		        to yield from `generator` before declaring one epoch
		        finished and starting the next epoch. It should typically
		        be equal to the number of samples of your dataset
		        divided by the batch size.
		        Optional for `Sequence`: if unspecified, will use
		        the `len(generator)` as a number of steps.
		    epochs: Integer, total number of iterations on the data.
		    verbose: Verbosity mode, 0, 1, or 2.
		    callbacks: List of callbacks to be called during training.
		    validation_data: This can be either
		        - a generator for the validation data
		        - a tuple (inputs, targets)
		        - a tuple (inputs, targets, sample_weights).
		    validation_steps: Only relevant if `validation_data`
		        is a generator. Total number of steps (batches of samples)
		        to yield from `generator` before stopping.
		        Optional for `Sequence`: if unspecified, will use
		        the `len(validation_data)` as a number of steps.
		    class_weight: Dictionary mapping class indices to a weight
		        for the class.
		    max_queue_size: Integer. Maximum size for the generator queue.
		        If unspecified, `max_queue_size` will default to 10.
		    workers: Integer. Maximum number of processes to spin up
		        when using process-based threading.
		        If unspecified, `workers` will default to 1. If 0, will
		        execute the generator on the main thread.
		    use_multiprocessing: Boolean.
		        If `True`, use process-based threading.
		        If unspecified, `use_multiprocessing` will default to `False`.
		        Note that because this implementation relies on multiprocessing,
		        you should not pass non-picklable arguments to the generator
		        as they can't be passed easily to children processes.
		    shuffle: Boolean. Whether to shuffle the order of the batches at
		        the beginning of each epoch. Only used with instances
		        of `Sequence` (`keras.utils.Sequence`).
		        Has no effect when `steps_per_epoch` is not `None`.
		    initial_epoch: Epoch at which to start training
		        (useful for resuming a previous training run)
		
		Returns:
		    A `History` object.
		
		Example:
		
		```python
		    def generate_arrays_from_file(path):
		        while 1:
		            f = open(path)
		            for line in f:

	/**
		Saves all layer weights.
		
		Either saves in HDF5 or in TensorFlow format based on the `save_format`
		argument.
		
		When saving in HDF5 format, the weight file has:
		  - `layer_names` (attribute), a list of strings
		      (ordered names of model layers).
		  - For every layer, a `group` named `layer.name`
		      - For every such layer group, a group attribute `weight_names`,
		          a list of strings
		          (ordered names of weights tensor of the layer).
		      - For every weight in the layer, a dataset
		          storing the weight value, named after the weight tensor.
		
		When saving in TensorFlow format, all objects referenced by the network are
		saved in the same format as `tf.train.Checkpoint`, including any `Layer`
		instances or `Optimizer` instances assigned to object attributes. For
		networks constructed from inputs and outputs using `tf.keras.Model(inputs,
		outputs)`, `Layer` instances used by the network are tracked/saved
		automatically. For user-defined classes which inherit from `tf.keras.Model`,
		`Layer` instances must be assigned to object attributes, typically in the
		constructor. See the documentation of `tf.train.Checkpoint` and
		`tf.keras.Model` for details.
		
		Arguments:
		    filepath: String, path to the file to save the weights to. When saving
		        in TensorFlow format, this is the prefix used for checkpoint files
		        (multiple files are generated). Note that the '.h5' suffix causes
		        weights to be saved in HDF5 format.
		    overwrite: Whether to silently overwrite any existing file at the
		        target location, or provide the user with a manual prompt.
		    save_format: Either 'tf' or 'h5'. A `filepath` ending in '.h5' or
		        '.keras' will default to HDF5 if `save_format` is `None`. Otherwise
		        `None` defaults to 'tf'.
		
		Raises:
		    ImportError: If h5py is not available when attempting to save in HDF5
		        format.
		    ValueError: For invalid/unknown format arguments.

		    y: Target data. Like the input data `x`,

		      It should be consistent with `x` (you cannot have Numpy inputs and
