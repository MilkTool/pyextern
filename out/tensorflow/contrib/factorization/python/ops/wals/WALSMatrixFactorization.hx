		available in the SKCompat class, Estimator will only accept input_fn.
		Example conversion:
		  est = Estimator(...) -> est = SKCompat(Estimator(...))
		
		Args:
		  x: Matrix of shape [n_samples, n_features...]. Can be iterator that
		     returns arrays of features. The training input samples for fitting the
		     model. If set, `input_fn` must be `None`.
		  input_fn: Input function. If set, `x` and 'batch_size' must be `None`.
		  batch_size: Override default batch size. If set, 'input_fn' must be
		    'None'.
		  outputs: list of `str`, name of the output to predict.
		    If `None`, returns all.
		  as_iterable: If True, return an iterable which keeps yielding predictions
		    for each example until inputs are exhausted. Note: The inputs must
		    terminate if you want the iterable to terminate (e.g. be sure to pass
		    num_epochs=1 if you are using something like read_batch_features).
		  iterate_batches: If True, yield the whole batch at once instead of
		    decomposing the batch into individual samples. Only relevant when
		    as_iterable is True.
		
		Returns:
		  A numpy array of predicted classes or regression values if the
		  constructor's `model_fn` returns a `Tensor` for `predictions` or a `dict`
		  of numpy arrays if `model_fn` returns a `dict`. Returns an iterable of
		  predictions if as_iterable is True.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If x and input_fn are both provided or both `None`.

		component of a nested object.
