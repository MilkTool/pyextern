		measurable element of `predictions` is scaled by the corresponding value of
		`weights`.
		
		Args:
		  predictions: The predicted outputs.
		  labels: The ground truth output tensor, same dimensions as 'predictions'.
		  weights: Coefficients for the loss a scalar, a tensor of shape
		    [batch_size] or a tensor whose shape matches `predictions`.

		Adds a pairwise-errors-squared loss to the training procedure. (deprecated)
		
		Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed after 2016-12-30.
		Instructions for updating:
		Use tf.losses.mean_pairwise_squared_error instead. Note that the order of the predictions and labels arguments has been changed.
		
		Unlike `mean_squared_error`, which is a measure of the differences between
		corresponding elements of `predictions` and `labels`,
		`mean_pairwise_squared_error` is a measure of the differences between pairs of
		corresponding elements of `predictions` and `labels`.
		
		For example, if `labels`=[a, b, c] and `predictions`=[x, y, z], there are
		three pairs of differences are summed to compute the loss:
		  loss = [ ((a-b) - (x-y)).^2 + ((a-c) - (x-z)).^2 + ((b-c) - (y-z)).^2 ] / 3
		
		Note that since the inputs are of size [batch_size, d0, ... dN], the
		corresponding pairs are computed within each batch sample but not across
		samples within a batch. For example, if `predictions` represents a batch of
		16 grayscale images of dimension [batch_size, 100, 200], then the set of pairs
		is drawn from each image, but not across images.
		
		`weights` acts as a coefficient for the loss. If a scalar is provided, then

		Args:
		  predictions: The predicted outputs, a tensor of size [batch_size, d0, .. dN]
		    where N+1 is the total number of dimensions in `predictions`.
		  labels: The ground truth output tensor, whose shape must match the shape of
