	/**
		Trimmed exponential loss given labels, example weights and predictions.
		
		Note that this is only for binary classification.
		If logistic loss tries to make sure that the classifier is certain of its
		predictions, exp loss says: "as long as it got it correct, even barely, i
		don't care". Can be used on noisy data, or when you don't care about getting
		the actual probabilities from the model, just the correct label.
		
		The loss returns is exp(-targets*modified_predictions), where
		modified_predictions are 1 if sigmoid is >= 0.5+eps (eg we predict positive
		class), -1 if sigmoid < 0.5-eps (e.g. we predict negative class) and ax+b in
		the interval 0.5-eps, 0.5+eps, where a = 1/eps, b=1/(2eps).
		
		Args:
		  labels: Rank 2 (N, D) tensor of per-example labels.
		  weights: Rank 2 (N, 1) tensor of per-example weights.
		  predictions: Rank 2 (N, D) tensor of per-example predictions.
		  name: A name for the operation (optional).
		  eps: For the range (0.5-eps, 0.5+eps) we set the predictions to be ax+b.
		
		Returns:
		  loss: A Rank 2 (N, 1) tensor of per-example exp loss
		  update_op: An update operation to update the loss's internal state.
