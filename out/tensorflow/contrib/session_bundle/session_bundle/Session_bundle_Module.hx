	/**
		Decorator for marking functions or methods deprecated.
		
		This decorator logs a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is
		called. It has the following format:
		
		  <function> (from <module>) is deprecated and will be removed after <date>.
		  Instructions for updating:
		  <instructions>
		
		If `date` is None, 'after <date>' is replaced with 'in a future version'.
		<function> will include the class name if it is a method.
		
		It also edits the docstring of the function: ' (deprecated)' is appended
		to the first line of the docstring and a deprecation notice is prepended
		to the rest of the docstring.
		
		Args:
		  date: String or None. The date the function is scheduled to be removed.
		    Must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD), or None.
		  instructions: String. Instructions on how to update code using the
		    deprecated function.
		  warn_once: Boolean. Set to `True` to warn only the first time the decorated
		    function is called. Otherwise, every call will log a warning.
		
		Returns:
		  Decorated function or method.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If date is not None or in ISO 8601 format, or instructions are
		    empty.

		Load session bundle from the given path. (deprecated)
		
		THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed after 2017-06-30.
		Instructions for updating:
		No longer supported. Switch to SavedModel immediately.
		
		The function reads input from the export_dir, constructs the graph data to the
		default graph and restores the parameters for the session created.
		
		Args:
		  export_dir: the directory that contains files exported by exporter.
		  target: The execution engine to connect to. See target in tf.Session()
		  config: A ConfigProto proto with configuration options. See config in
		  tf.Session()
		  meta_graph_def: optional object of type MetaGraphDef. If this object is
		  present, then it is used instead of parsing MetaGraphDef from export_dir.
		
		Returns:
		  session: a tensorflow session created from the variable files.
		  meta_graph: a meta graph proto saved in the exporter directory.
		
		Raises:
		  RuntimeError: if the required files are missing or contain unrecognizable
		  fields, i.e. the exported model is invalid.
