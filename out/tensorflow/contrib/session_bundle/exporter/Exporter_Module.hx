		Creates a classification signature. (deprecated)

		Args:
		  input_tensor: Tensor specifying the input to a graph.
		  classes_tensor: Tensor specifying the output classes of a graph.
		  scores_tensor: Tensor specifying the scores of the output classes.
		
		Returns:

		Decorator for marking functions or methods deprecated.
		
		This decorator logs a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is
		called. It has the following format:
		
		  <function> (from <module>) is deprecated and will be removed after <date>.
		  Instructions for updating:
		  <instructions>
		
		If `date` is None, 'after <date>' is replaced with 'in a future version'.
		<function> will include the class name if it is a method.
		
		It also edits the docstring of the function: ' (deprecated)' is appended
		to the first line of the docstring and a deprecation notice is prepended
		to the rest of the docstring.
		
		Args:
		  date: String or None. The date the function is scheduled to be removed.
		    Must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD), or None.
		  instructions: String. Instructions on how to update code using the
		    deprecated function.
		  warn_once: Boolean. Set to `True` to warn only the first time the decorated
		    function is called. Otherwise, every call will log a warning.
		
		Returns:
		  Decorated function or method.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If date is not None or in ISO 8601 format, or instructions are
		    empty.

		THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed after 2017-06-30.
		Instructions for updating:
		No longer supported. Switch to SavedModel immediately.
		
		This method is used as the default `assets_callback` in `Exporter.init` to
		copy assets from the `assets_collection`. It can also be invoked directly to
		copy additional supplementary files into the export directory (in which case
		it is not a callback).
		
		Args:
		  files_to_copy: A dictionary that maps original file paths to desired
		    basename in the export directory.
		  export_dir_path: Directory to copy the files to.
