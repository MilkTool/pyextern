		  initial_states_fw: (optional) A list of the initial states (one per layer)
		    for the forward RNN.
		    Each tensor must has an appropriate type and shape

		  parallel_iterations: (Default: 32).  The number of iterations to run in
		    parallel.  Those operations which do not have any temporal dependency
		    and can be run in parallel, will be.  This parameter trades off
		    time for space.  Values >> 1 use more memory but take less time,
		    while smaller values use less memory but computations take longer.
		  time_major: The shape format of the inputs and outputs Tensors. If true,
		    these Tensors must be shaped [max_time, batch_size, depth]. If false,
		    these Tensors must be shaped [batch_size, max_time, depth]. Using
		    time_major = True is a bit more efficient because it avoids transposes at

		      are depth-concatenated forward and backward outputs.
		    output_states_fw is the final states, one tensor per layer,
		      of the forward rnn.
		    output_states_bw is the final states, one tensor per layer,

		Creates a recurrent neural network specified by RNNCell `cell`. (deprecated)
		
		Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
		Instructions for updating:
		Please use `keras.layers.RNN(cell, unroll=True)`, which is equivalent to this API
		
		The simplest form of RNN network generated is:
		
		```python
		  state = cell.zero_state(...)
		  outputs = []
		  for input_ in inputs:
		    output, state = cell(input_, state)
		    outputs.append(output)
		  return (outputs, state)
		```
		However, a few other options are available:
		
		An initial state can be provided.
		If the sequence_length vector is provided, dynamic calculation is performed.
		This method of calculation does not compute the RNN steps past the maximum
		sequence length of the minibatch (thus saving computational time),
		and properly propagates the state at an example's sequence length
		to the final state output.
		
		The dynamic calculation performed is, at time `t` for batch row `b`,
		
		```python
		  (output, state)(b, t) =
		    (t >= sequence_length(b))
		      ? (zeros(cell.output_size), states(b, sequence_length(b) - 1))
		      : cell(input(b, t), state(b, t - 1))
		```
		
		Args:
		  cell: An instance of RNNCell.
		  inputs: A length T list of inputs, each a `Tensor` of shape
		    `[batch_size, input_size]`, or a nested tuple of such elements.
		  initial_state: (optional) An initial state for the RNN.
		    If `cell.state_size` is an integer, this must be
		    a `Tensor` of appropriate type and shape `[batch_size, cell.state_size]`.
		    If `cell.state_size` is a tuple, this should be a tuple of
		    tensors having shapes `[batch_size, s] for s in cell.state_size`.
		  dtype: (optional) The data type for the initial state and expected output.
		    Required if initial_state is not provided or RNN state has a heterogeneous
		    dtype.
		  sequence_length: Specifies the length of each sequence in inputs.
		    An int32 or int64 vector (tensor) size `[batch_size]`, values in `[0, T)`.
		  scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to "rnn".
		
		Returns:
		  A pair (outputs, state) where:
		
		  - outputs is a length T list of outputs (one for each input), or a nested
		    tuple of such elements.
		  - state is the final state
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: If `cell` is not an instance of RNNCell.
		  ValueError: If `inputs` is `None` or an empty list, or if the input depth
		    (column size) cannot be inferred from inputs via shape inference.
