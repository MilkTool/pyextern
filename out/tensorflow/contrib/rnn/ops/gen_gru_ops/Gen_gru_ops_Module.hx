		```
		x_h_prev = [x, h_prev]
		
		[r_bar u_bar] = x_h_prev * w_ru + b_ru
		
		r = sigmoid(r_bar)
		u = sigmoid(u_bar)

		Concatenation of a and b is represented by a_b
		Element-wise dot product of a and b is represented by ab
		Element-wise dot product is represented by \circ
		Matrix multiplication is represented by *
		
		Additional notes for clarity:
		
		`w_ru` can be segmented into 4 different matrices.
		```
		w_ru = [w_r_x w_u_x
		        w_r_h_prev w_u_h_prev]
		```
		Similarly, `w_c` can be segmented into 2 different matrices.
		```
		w_c = [w_c_x w_c_h_prevr]
		```
		Same goes for biases.
		```
		b_ru = [b_ru_x b_ru_h]
		b_c = [b_c_x b_c_h]
		```
		Another note on notation:
		```
		d_x = d_x_component_1 + d_x_component_2
		
		where d_x_component_1 = d_r_bar * w_r_x^T + d_u_bar * w_r_x^T
		and d_x_component_2 = d_c_bar * w_c_x^T
		
		d_h_prev = d_h_prev_component_1 + d_h_prevr \circ r + d_h \circ u
		where d_h_prev_componenet_1 = d_r_bar * w_r_h_prev^T + d_u_bar * w_r_h_prev^T
		```
		
		Mathematics behind the Gradients below:
		```
		d_c_bar = d_h \circ (1-u) \circ (1-c \circ c)
		d_u_bar = d_h \circ (h-c) \circ u \circ (1-u)
		
		d_r_bar_u_bar = [d_r_bar d_u_bar]
		
		[d_x_component_1 d_h_prev_component_1] = d_r_bar_u_bar * w_ru^T
		
		[d_x_component_2 d_h_prevr] = d_c_bar * w_c^T
		
		d_x = d_x_component_1 + d_x_component_2
		
		d_h_prev = d_h_prev_component_1 + d_h_prevr \circ r + u
		```
		Below calculation is performed in the python wrapper for the Gradients
		(not in the gradient kernel.)
		```
		d_w_ru = x_h_prevr^T * d_c_bar
		
		d_w_c = x_h_prev^T * d_r_bar_u_bar
		
		d_b_ru = sum of d_r_bar_u_bar along axis = 0
		
		d_b_c = sum of d_c_bar along axis = 0
