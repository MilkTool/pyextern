		Creates a _TargetColumn for binary classification with SVMs. (deprecated)

		Instructions for updating:

		The target column uses binary hinge loss.
		
		Args:
		  label_name: String, name of the key in label dict. Can be null if label
		    is a tensor (single headed models).
		  weight_column_name: A string defining feature column name representing
		    weights. It is used to down weight or boost examples during training. It
		    will be multiplied by the loss of the example.
		
		Returns:
		  An instance of _TargetColumn.

		Decorator for marking functions or methods deprecated.
		
		This decorator logs a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is
		called. It has the following format:
		
		  <function> (from <module>) is deprecated and will be removed after <date>.
		  Instructions for updating:
		  <instructions>
		
		If `date` is None, 'after <date>' is replaced with 'in a future version'.
		<function> will include the class name if it is a method.
		
		It also edits the docstring of the function: ' (deprecated)' is appended
		to the first line of the docstring and a deprecation notice is prepended
		to the rest of the docstring.
		
		Args:
		  date: String or None. The date the function is scheduled to be removed.
		    Must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD), or None.
		  instructions: String. Instructions on how to update code using the
		    deprecated function.
		  warn_once: Boolean. Set to `True` to warn only the first time the decorated
		    function is called. Otherwise, every call will log a warning.
		
		Returns:
		  Decorated function or method.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If date is not None or in ISO 8601 format, or instructions are
		    empty.
