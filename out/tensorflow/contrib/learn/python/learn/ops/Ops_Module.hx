		Creates an embedding for categorical variable with given number of classes. (deprecated)
		
		THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed after 2016-12-01.
		Instructions for updating:
		Use `tf.contrib.layers.embed_sequence` instead.
		
		Args:
		  tensor_in: Input tensor with class identifier (can be batch or
		    N-dimensional).
		  n_classes: Number of classes.
		  embedding_size: Size of embedding vector to represent each class.
		  name: Name of this categorical variable.
		Returns:
		  Tensor of input shape, with additional dimension for embedding.
		
		Example:
		  Calling categorical_variable([1, 2], 5, 10, "my_cat"), will return 2 x 10
		  tensor, where each row is representation of the class.

		Decorator for marking functions or methods deprecated.
		
		This decorator logs a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is
		called. It has the following format:
		
		  <function> (from <module>) is deprecated and will be removed after <date>.
		  Instructions for updating:
		  <instructions>
		
		If `date` is None, 'after <date>' is replaced with 'in a future version'.
		<function> will include the class name if it is a method.
		
		It also edits the docstring of the function: ' (deprecated)' is appended
		to the first line of the docstring and a deprecation notice is prepended
		to the rest of the docstring.
		
		Args:
		  date: String or None. The date the function is scheduled to be removed.
		    Must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD), or None.
		  instructions: String. Instructions on how to update code using the
		    deprecated function.
		  warn_once: Boolean. Set to `True` to warn only the first time the decorated
		    function is called. Otherwise, every call will log a warning.
		
		Returns:
		  Decorated function or method.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If date is not None or in ISO 8601 format, or instructions are
