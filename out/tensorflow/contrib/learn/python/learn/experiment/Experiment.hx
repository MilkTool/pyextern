		Interleaves training and evaluation. (experimental)
		
		THIS FUNCTION IS EXPERIMENTAL. It may change or be removed at any time, and without warning.
		
		The frequency of evaluation is controlled by the `train_steps_per_iteration`
		(via constructor). The model will be first trained for
		`train_steps_per_iteration`, and then be evaluated in turns.
		
		This method is intended for single machine usage.
		
		This differs from `train_and_evaluate` as follows:
		
		  1. The procedure will have train and evaluation in turns. The model
		  will be trained for a number of steps (usually smaller than `train_steps`
		  if provided) and then be evaluated.  `train_and_evaluate` will train the
		  model for `train_steps` (no small training iterations).
		
		  2. Due to the different approach this schedule takes, it leads to two
		  differences in resource control. First, the resources (e.g., memory) used
		  by training will be released before evaluation (`train_and_evaluate` takes
		  double resources). Second, more checkpoints will be saved as a checkpoint
		  is generated at the end of each training iteration.
		
		  3. As the estimator.train starts from scratch (new graph, new states for
		  input, etc) at each iteration, it is recommended to have the
		  `train_steps_per_iteration` larger. It is also recommended to shuffle your
		  input.
		
		Args:
		  continuous_eval_predicate_fn: A predicate function determining whether to
		    continue eval after each iteration. A `predicate_fn` has one of the
		    following signatures:
		      * (eval_results) -> boolean
		      * (eval_results, checkpoint_path) -> boolean
		    Where `eval_results` is the dictionary of metric evaluations and
		    checkpoint_path is the path to the checkpoint containing the parameters
		    on which that evaluation was based.
		    At the beginning of evaluation, the passed `eval_results` and
		    `checkpoint_path` will be None so it's expected that the predicate
		    function handles that gracefully.
		    When `predicate_fn` is not specified, continuous eval will run in an
		    infinite loop (if `train_steps` is None). or exit once global step
		    reaches `train_steps`.
		
		Returns:
		  A tuple of the result of the `evaluate` call to the `Estimator` and the
		  export results using the specified `ExportStrategy`.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: if `continuous_eval_predicate_fn` is neither None nor
