		Decorator for marking functions or methods deprecated.
		
		This decorator logs a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is
		called. It has the following format:
		
		  <function> (from <module>) is deprecated and will be removed after <date>.
		  Instructions for updating:
		  <instructions>
		
		If `date` is None, 'after <date>' is replaced with 'in a future version'.
		<function> will include the class name if it is a method.
		
		It also edits the docstring of the function: ' (deprecated)' is appended
		to the first line of the docstring and a deprecation notice is prepended
		to the rest of the docstring.
		
		Args:
		  date: String or None. The date the function is scheduled to be removed.
		    Must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD), or None.
		  instructions: String. Instructions on how to update code using the
		    deprecated function.
		  warn_once: Boolean. Set to `True` to warn only the first time the decorated
		    function is called. Otherwise, every call will log a warning.
		
		Returns:
		  Decorated function or method.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If date is not None or in ISO 8601 format, or instructions are
		    empty.

		Decorator for marking functions or methods experimental.
		
		This decorator logs an experimental warning whenever the decorated function is

		  <function> (from <module>) is experimental and may change or be removed at
		  any time, and without warning.
		
		<function> will include the class name if it is a method.
		
		It also edits the docstring of the function: ' (experimental)' is appended
		to the first line of the docstring and a notice is prepended to the rest of
		the docstring.
		
		Args:
		  func: A function or method to mark experimental.
		
		Returns:
		  Decorated function or method.
