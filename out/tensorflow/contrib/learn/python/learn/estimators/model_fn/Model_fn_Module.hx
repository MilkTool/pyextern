	/**
		Decorator for marking functions or methods deprecated.
		
		This decorator logs a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is
		called. It has the following format:
		
		  <function> (from <module>) is deprecated and will be removed after <date>.
		  Instructions for updating:
		  <instructions>
		
		If `date` is None, 'after <date>' is replaced with 'in a future version'.
		<function> will include the class name if it is a method.
		
		It also edits the docstring of the function: ' (deprecated)' is appended
		to the first line of the docstring and a deprecation notice is prepended
		to the rest of the docstring.
		
		Args:
		  date: String or None. The date the function is scheduled to be removed.
		    Must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD), or None.
		  instructions: String. Instructions on how to update code using the
		    deprecated function.
		  warn_once: Boolean. Set to `True` to warn only the first time the decorated
		    function is called. Otherwise, every call will log a warning.
		
		Returns:
		  Decorated function or method.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If date is not None or in ISO 8601 format, or instructions are
		    empty.

		Returns the appropriate graph to use for the given inputs.
		
		1. If `graph` is provided, we validate that all inputs in `op_input_list` are
		   from the same graph.
		2. Otherwise, we attempt to select a graph from the first Operation- or
		   Tensor-valued input in `op_input_list`, and validate that all other
		   such inputs are in the same graph.
		3. If the graph was not specified and it could not be inferred from
		   `op_input_list`, we attempt to use the default graph.
		
		Args:
		  op_input_list: A list of inputs to an operation, which may include `Tensor`,
		    `Operation`, and other objects that may be converted to a graph element.
		  graph: (Optional) The explicit graph to use.
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: If `op_input_list` is not a list or tuple, or if graph is not a
		    Graph.
		  ValueError: If a graph is explicitly passed and not all inputs are from it,
		    or if the inputs are from multiple graphs, or we could not find a graph
		    and there was no default graph.
		
		Returns:
		  The appropriate graph to use for the given inputs.
