		Decorator for marking functions or methods deprecated.
		
		This decorator logs a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is
		called. It has the following format:
		
		  <function> (from <module>) is deprecated and will be removed after <date>.
		  Instructions for updating:
		  <instructions>
		
		If `date` is None, 'after <date>' is replaced with 'in a future version'.
		<function> will include the class name if it is a method.
		
		It also edits the docstring of the function: ' (deprecated)' is appended
		to the first line of the docstring and a deprecation notice is prepended
		to the rest of the docstring.
		
		Args:
		  date: String or None. The date the function is scheduled to be removed.
		    Must be ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD), or None.
		  instructions: String. Instructions on how to update code using the
		    deprecated function.
		  warn_once: Boolean. Set to `True` to warn only the first time the decorated
		    function is called. Otherwise, every call will log a warning.
		
		Returns:
		  Decorated function or method.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If date is not None or in ISO 8601 format, or instructions are
		    empty.

		Produces the content of `output_tensor` only after `dependencies`.
		
		In some cases, a user may want the output of an operation to be
		consumed externally only after some other dependencies have run
		first. This function ensures returns `output_tensor`, but only after all
		operations in `dependencies` have run. Note that this means that there is
		no guarantee that `output_tensor` will be evaluated after any `dependencies`
		have run.
		
		See also `tf.tuple` and `tf.group`.
		
		Args:
		  dependencies: Iterable of operations to run before this op finishes.
		  output_tensor: A `Tensor` or `IndexedSlices` that will be returned.
		  name: (Optional) A name for this operation.
		
		Returns:
		  Same as `output_tensor`.
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: if `output_tensor` is not a `Tensor` or `IndexedSlices`.
