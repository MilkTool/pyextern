		Builds a logistic regression Estimator for binary classification.
		
		THIS CLASS IS DEPRECATED. See
		[contrib/learn/README.md](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/learn/README.md)
		for general migration instructions.
		
		This method provides a basic Estimator with some additional metrics for custom
		binary classification models, including AUC, precision/recall and accuracy.
		
		Example:
		
		```python
		  # See tf.contrib.learn.Estimator(...) for details on model_fn structure
		  def my_model_fn(...):
		    pass
		
		  estimator = LogisticRegressor(model_fn=my_model_fn)
		
		  # Input builders
		  def input_fn_train:
		    pass
		
		  estimator.fit(input_fn=input_fn_train)
		  estimator.predict(x=x)
		```
		
		Args:
		  model_fn: Model function with the signature:
		    `(features, labels, mode) -> (predictions, loss, train_op)`.
		    Expects the returned predictions to be probabilities in [0.0, 1.0].
		  thresholds: List of floating point thresholds to use for accuracy,
		    precision, and recall metrics. If `None`, defaults to `[0.5]`.
		  model_dir: Directory to save model parameters, graphs, etc. This can also
		    be used to load checkpoints from the directory into a estimator to
		    continue training a previously saved model.
		  config: A RunConfig configuration object.
		  feature_engineering_fn: Feature engineering function. Takes features and
		                    labels which are the output of `input_fn` and
		                    returns features and labels which will be fed
		                    into the model.
		
		Returns:
		  An `Estimator` instance.

		Given `graph`, a directory to write summaries to (`output_dir`), a checkpoint
		to restore variables from, and a `dict` of `Tensor`s to evaluate, run an eval
		loop for `max_steps` steps, or until an exception (generally, an
		end-of-input signal from a reader operation) is raised from running
		`eval_dict`.
		
		In each step of evaluation, all tensors in the `eval_dict` are evaluated, and
		every `log_every_steps` steps, they are logged. At the very end of evaluation,
		a summary is evaluated (finding the summary ops using `Supervisor`'s logic)
		and written to `output_dir`.
		
		Args:
		  graph: A `Graph` to train. It is expected that this graph is not in use
		    elsewhere.
		  output_dir: A string containing the directory to write a summary to.
		  checkpoint_path: A string containing the path to a checkpoint to restore.
		    Can be `None` if the graph doesn't require loading any variables.
		  eval_dict: A `dict` mapping string names to tensors to evaluate. It is
		    evaluated in every logging step. The result of the final evaluation is
		    returned. If `update_op` is None, then it's evaluated in every step. If
		    `max_steps` is `None`, this should depend on a reader that will raise an
		    end-of-input exception when the inputs are exhausted.
		  update_op: A `Tensor` which is run in every step.
		  global_step_tensor: A `Variable` containing the global step. If `None`,
		    one is extracted from the graph using the same logic as in `Supervisor`.
		    Used to place eval summaries on training curves.
		  supervisor_master: The master string to use when preparing the session.
		  log_every_steps: Integer. Output logs every `log_every_steps` evaluation
		    steps. The logs contain the `eval_dict` and timing information.
		  feed_fn: A function that is called every iteration to produce a `feed_dict`
		    passed to `session.run` calls. Optional.
		  max_steps: Integer. Evaluate `eval_dict` this many times.
		
		Returns:
		  A tuple `(eval_results, global_step)`:
		  eval_results: A `dict` mapping `string` to numeric values (`int`, `float`)
		    that are the result of running eval_dict in the last step. `None` if no
		    eval steps were run.
		  global_step: The global step this evaluation corresponds to.

		Given `graph`, a directory to write outputs to (`output_dir`), and some ops,

		counting training steps. This function uses `Supervisor` to initialize the
		graph (from a checkpoint if one is available in `output_dir`), write summaries
		defined in the graph, and write regular checkpoints as defined by
		`supervisor_save_model_secs`.
		
		Training continues until `global_step_tensor` evaluates to `max_steps`, or, if
		`fail_on_nan_loss`, until `loss_op` evaluates to `NaN`. In that case the
		program is terminated with exit code 1.
		
		Args:
		  graph: A graph to train. It is expected that this graph is not in use

		  output_dir: A directory to write outputs to.
		  train_op: An op that performs one training step when run.
		  loss_op: A scalar loss tensor.
		  global_step_tensor: A tensor representing the global step. If none is given,
		    one is extracted from the graph using the same logic as in `Supervisor`.
		  init_op: An op that initializes the graph. If `None`, use `Supervisor`'s
		    default.
		  init_feed_dict: A dictionary that maps `Tensor` objects to feed values.
		    This feed dictionary will be used when `init_op` is evaluated.
		  init_fn: Optional callable passed to Supervisor to initialize the model.
		  log_every_steps: Output logs regularly. The logs contain timing data and the
		    current loss.
		  supervisor_is_chief: Whether the current process is the chief supervisor in
		    charge of restoring the model and running standard services.
		  supervisor_master: The master string to use when preparing the session.
		  supervisor_save_model_secs: Save a checkpoint every
		    `supervisor_save_model_secs` seconds when training.
		  keep_checkpoint_max: The maximum number of recent checkpoint files to
		    keep. As new files are created, older files are deleted. If None or 0,
		    all checkpoint files are kept. This is simply passed as the max_to_keep
		    arg to tf.train.Saver constructor.
		  supervisor_save_summaries_steps: Save summaries every
		    `supervisor_save_summaries_steps` seconds when training.
		  feed_fn: A function that is called every iteration to produce a `feed_dict`
		    passed to `session.run` calls. Optional.
		  steps: Trains for this many steps (e.g. current global step + `steps`).
		  fail_on_nan_loss: If true, raise `NanLossDuringTrainingError` if `loss_op`
		    evaluates to `NaN`. If false, continue training as if nothing happened.
		  monitors: List of `BaseMonitor` subclass instances. Used for callbacks
		    inside the training loop.
		  max_steps: Number of total steps for which to train model. If `None`,
		    train forever. Two calls fit(steps=100) means 200 training iterations.
		    On the other hand two calls of fit(max_steps=100) means, second call
