	/**
		Batches the computation done by the decorated function.
		
		So, for example, in the following code
		
		```python
		@batch_function(1, 2, 3)
		def layer(a):
		  return tf.matmul(a, a)
		
		b = layer(w)
		```
		
		if more than one session.run call is simultaneously trying to compute `b`
		the values of `w` will be gathered, non-deterministically concatenated
		along the first axis, and only one thread will run the computation. See the
		documentation of the `Batch` op for more details.
		
		Assumes that all arguments of the decorated function are Tensors which will
		be batched along their first dimension.
		
		SparseTensor is not supported. The return value of the decorated function
		must be a Tensor or a list/tuple of Tensors.
		
		Args:
		  num_batch_threads: Number of scheduling threads for processing batches
		   of work. Determines the number of batches processed in parallel.
		  max_batch_size: Batch sizes will never be bigger than this.
		  batch_timeout_micros: Maximum number of microseconds to wait before
		   outputting an incomplete batch.
		  allowed_batch_sizes: Optional list of allowed batch sizes. If left empty,
		   does nothing. Otherwise, supplies a list of batch sizes, causing the op
		   to pad batches up to one of those sizes. The entries must increase
		   monotonically, and the final entry must equal max_batch_size.
		  max_enqueued_batches: The maximum depth of the batch queue. Defaults to 10.
		
		Returns:
		  The decorated function will return the unbatched computation output Tensors.
