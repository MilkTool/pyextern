		Default loss definition with state replicated across a batch.
		
		Time series passed to this model have a batch dimension, and each series in
		a batch can be operated on in parallel. This loss definition assumes that
		each element of the batch represents an independent sample conditioned on
		the same initial state (i.e. it is simply replicated across the batch). A
		batch size of one provides sequential operations on a single time series.
		
		More complex processing may operate instead on get_start_state() and
		get_batch_loss() directly.
		
		Args:
		  features: A dictionary (such as is produced by a chunker) with at minimum
		    the following key/value pairs (others corresponding to the
		    `exogenous_feature_columns` argument to `__init__` may be included
		    representing exogenous regressors):
		    TrainEvalFeatures.TIMES: A [batch size x window size] integer Tensor
		        with times for each observation. If there is no artificial chunking,
		        the window size is simply the length of the time series.
		    TrainEvalFeatures.VALUES: A [batch size x window size x num features]
		        Tensor with values for each observation.
		  mode: The tf.estimator.ModeKeys mode to use (TRAIN, EVAL). For INFER,
		    see predict().
		Returns:
		  A ModelOutputs object.
