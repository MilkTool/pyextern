	/**
		Generator for v1 ResNet models.
		
		This function generates a family of ResNet v1 models. See the resnet_v1_*()
		methods for specific model instantiations, obtained by selecting different
		block instantiations that produce ResNets of various depths.
		
		Training for image classification on Imagenet is usually done with [224, 224]
		inputs, resulting in [7, 7] feature maps at the output of the last ResNet
		block for the ResNets defined in [1] that have nominal stride equal to 32.
		However, for dense prediction tasks we advise that one uses inputs with
		spatial dimensions that are multiples of 32 plus 1, e.g., [321, 321]. In
		this case the feature maps at the ResNet output will have spatial shape
		[(height - 1) / output_stride + 1, (width - 1) / output_stride + 1]
		and corners exactly aligned with the input image corners, which greatly
		facilitates alignment of the features to the image. Using as input [225, 225]
		images results in [8, 8] feature maps at the output of the last ResNet block.
		
		For dense prediction tasks, the ResNet needs to run in fully-convolutional
		(FCN) mode and global_pool needs to be set to False. The ResNets in [1, 2] all
		have nominal stride equal to 32 and a good choice in FCN mode is to use
		output_stride=16 in order to increase the density of the computed features at
		small computational and memory overhead, cf. http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00915.
		
		Args:
		  inputs: A tensor of size [batch, height_in, width_in, channels].
		  blocks: A list of length equal to the number of ResNet blocks. Each element
		    is a resnet_utils.Block object describing the units in the block.
		  num_classes: Number of predicted classes for classification tasks. If None
		    we return the features before the logit layer.
		  is_training: whether batch_norm layers are in training mode.
		  global_pool: If True, we perform global average pooling before computing the
		    logits. Set to True for image classification, False for dense prediction.
		  output_stride: If None, then the output will be computed at the nominal
		    network stride. If output_stride is not None, it specifies the requested
		    ratio of input to output spatial resolution.
		  include_root_block: If True, include the initial convolution followed by
		    max-pooling, if False excludes it.
		  reuse: whether or not the network and its variables should be reused. To be
		    able to reuse 'scope' must be given.
		  scope: Optional variable_scope.
		
		Returns:
		  net: A rank-4 tensor of size [batch, height_out, width_out, channels_out].
		    If global_pool is False, then height_out and width_out are reduced by a
		    factor of output_stride compared to the respective height_in and width_in,
		    else both height_out and width_out equal one. If num_classes is None, then
		    net is the output of the last ResNet block, potentially after global
		    average pooling. If num_classes is not None, net contains the pre-softmax
		    activations.
		  end_points: A dictionary from components of the network to the corresponding
		    activation.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If the target output_stride is not valid.
