		A `SoftmaxNormal` random variable `Y` may be generated via

		Note: for a given `quadrature_size`, this method is generally less accurate

		Args:
		  normal_loc: `float`-like `Tensor` with shape `[b1, ..., bB, K-1]`, B>=0.
		    The location parameter of the Normal used to construct the SoftmaxNormal.
		  normal_scale: `float`-like `Tensor`. Broadcastable with `normal_loc`.
		    The scale parameter of the Normal used to construct the SoftmaxNormal.
		  quadrature_size: Python `int` scalar representing the number of quadrature
		    points.
		  validate_args: Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution
		    parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime
		    performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect
		    outputs.
		  name: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.
		
		Returns:
		  grid: Shape `[b1, ..., bB, K, quadrature_size]` `Tensor` representing the

		    `grid[..., :, n]` is the `n`-th grid point, living in the `K - 1` simplex.
		  probs:  Shape `[b1, ..., bB, K, quadrature_size]` `Tensor` representing the
