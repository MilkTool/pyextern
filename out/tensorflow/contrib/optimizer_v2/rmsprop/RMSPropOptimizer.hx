	/**
		Add operations to minimize `loss` by updating `var_list`.
		
		This method simply combines calls `compute_gradients()` and
		`apply_gradients()`. If you want to process the gradient before applying
		them call `compute_gradients()` and `apply_gradients()` explicitly instead
		of using this function.
		
		Args:
		  loss: A `Tensor` containing the value to minimize.
		  global_step: Optional `Variable` to increment by one after the
		    variables have been updated.
		  var_list: Optional list or tuple of `Variable` objects to update to
		    minimize `loss`.  Defaults to the list of variables collected in
		    the graph under the key `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`.
		  gate_gradients: How to gate the computation of gradients.  Can be
		    `GATE_NONE`, `GATE_OP`, or  `GATE_GRAPH`.
		  aggregation_method: Specifies the method used to combine gradient terms.
		    Valid values are defined in the class `AggregationMethod`.
		  colocate_gradients_with_ops: If True, try colocating gradients with
		    the corresponding op.
		  name: Optional name for the returned operation.
		  grad_loss: Optional. A `Tensor` holding the gradient computed for `loss`.
		  stop_gradients: Optional. A Tensor or list of tensors not to differentiate
		    through.
		  scale_loss_by_num_towers: Optional boolean. If true, scale the loss
		    down by the number of towers. By default, auto-detects whether this
		    is needed.
		
		Returns:
		  An Operation that updates the variables in `var_list`.  If `global_step`
		  was not `None`, that operation also increments `global_step`.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If some of the variables are not `Variable` objects.
		
		@compatibility(eager)
		When eager execution is enabled, `loss` should be a Python function that
		takes elements of `var_list` as arguments and computes the value to be
		minimized. If `var_list` is None, `loss` should take no arguments.
		Minimization (and gradient computation) is done with respect to the
		elements of `var_list` if not None, else with respect to any trainable
		variables created during the execution of the `loss` function.
		`gate_gradients`, `aggregation_method`, `colocate_gradients_with_ops` and
		`grad_loss` are ignored when eager execution is enabled.
