		Returns the appropriate graph to use for the given inputs.
		
		1. If `graph` is provided, we validate that all inputs in `op_input_list` are
		   from the same graph.
		2. Otherwise, we attempt to select a graph from the first Operation- or
		   Tensor-valued input in `op_input_list`, and validate that all other
		   such inputs are in the same graph.
		3. If the graph was not specified and it could not be inferred from
		   `op_input_list`, we attempt to use the default graph.
		
		Args:
		  op_input_list: A list of inputs to an operation, which may include `Tensor`,
		    `Operation`, and other objects that may be converted to a graph element.
		  graph: (Optional) The explicit graph to use.
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: If `op_input_list` is not a list or tuple, or if graph is not a
		    Graph.
		  ValueError: If a graph is explicitly passed and not all inputs are from it,
		    or if the inputs are from multiple graphs, or we could not find a graph
		    and there was no default graph.
		
		Returns:
		  The appropriate graph to use for the given inputs.

		Returns:
