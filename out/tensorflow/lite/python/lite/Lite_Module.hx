		Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(op_dict)`. They will be removed in a future version.
		Instructions for updating:
		Please file an issue at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues if you depend on this feature.
		
		This function provides a way to import a serialized TensorFlow
		[`GraphDef`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/framework/graph.proto)
		protocol buffer, and extract individual objects in the `GraphDef` as
		`tf.Tensor` and `tf.Operation` objects. Once extracted,

		`tf.Graph.as_graph_def` for a way to create a `GraphDef`
		proto.
		
		Args:
		  graph_def: A `GraphDef` proto containing operations to be imported into
		    the default graph.
		  input_map: A dictionary mapping input names (as strings) in `graph_def`
		    to `Tensor` objects. The values of the named input tensors in the
		    imported graph will be re-mapped to the respective `Tensor` values.
		  return_elements: A list of strings containing operation names in
		    `graph_def` that will be returned as `Operation` objects; and/or
		    tensor names in `graph_def` that will be returned as `Tensor` objects.
		  name: (Optional.) A prefix that will be prepended to the names in
		    `graph_def`. Note that this does not apply to imported function names.
		    Defaults to `"import"`.
		  op_dict: (Optional.) Deprecated, do not use.
		  producer_op_list: (Optional.) An `OpList` proto with the (possibly stripped)
		    list of `OpDef`s used by the producer of the graph. If provided,
		    unrecognized attrs for ops in `graph_def` that have their default value
		    according to `producer_op_list` will be removed. This will allow some more
		    `GraphDef`s produced by later binaries to be accepted by earlier binaries.
		
		Returns:

		  inference_input_type: Target data type of real-number input arrays. Allows
		    for a different type for input arrays in the case of quantization.
		    Must be `{tf.float32, tf.uint8}`. (default `inference_type`)
		  input_format: Type of data to read Currently must be
		    `{TENSORFLOW_GRAPHDEF}`. (default TENSORFLOW_GRAPHDEF)
		  input_shapes: Input array shape. It needs to be a list of the same length
		    as `input_tensors`, or None. (default None)
		  output_format: Output file format. Currently must be `{TFLITE,
		    GRAPHVIZ_DOT}`. (default TFLITE)

		    (default None)
		  default_ranges_stats: Tuple of integers representing (min, max) range values
		    for all arrays without a specified range. Intended for experimenting with
		    quantization via "dummy quantization". (default None)
		  drop_control_dependency: Boolean indicating whether to drop control
		    dependencies silently. This is due to TFLite not supporting control
		    dependencies. (default True)
		  reorder_across_fake_quant: Boolean indicating whether to reorder FakeQuant
		    nodes in unexpected locations. Used when the location of the FakeQuant
		    nodes is preventing graph transformations necessary to convert the graph.
		    Results in a graph that differs from the quantized training graph,
		    potentially causing differing arithmetic behavior. (default False)
		  allow_custom_ops: Boolean indicating whether to allow custom operations.
		    When false any unknown operation is an error. When true, custom ops are
		    created for any op that is unknown. The developer will need to provide
		    these to the TensorFlow Lite runtime with a custom resolver.
		    (default False)
		  change_concat_input_ranges: Boolean to change behavior of min/max ranges for
		    inputs and outputs of the concat operator for quantized models. Changes
		    the ranges of concat operator overlap when true. (default False)
		  post_training_quantize: Boolean indicating whether to quantize the weights
		    of the converted float model. Model size will be reduced and there will be
		    latency improvements (at the cost of accuracy).
		    (default False)
		  dump_graphviz_dir: Full filepath of folder to dump the graphs at various
		    stages of processing GraphViz .dot files. Preferred over
		    --output_format=GRAPHVIZ_DOT in order to keep the requirements of the
		    output file. (default None)
		  dump_graphviz_video: Boolean indicating whether to dump the graph after
		    every graph transformation. (default False)
		  target_ops: Experimental flag, subject to change. Set of OpsSet
		    options indicating which converter to use.
		    (default set([OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS]))
		  allow_nonexistent_arrays: Allow specifying array names that don't exist
		    or are unused in the final graph. (default False)
		
		Returns:
		  model_flags, toco_flags: two protocol buffers describing the conversion
		  process.
