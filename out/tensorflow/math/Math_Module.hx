	/**
		Computes the absolute value of a tensor.
		
		Given a tensor `x` of complex numbers, this operation returns a tensor of type
		`float32` or `float64` that is the absolute value of each element in `x`. All
		elements in `x` must be complex numbers of the form \\(a + bj\\). The
		absolute value is computed as \\( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).  For example:
		```python
		x = tf.constant([[-2.25 + 4.75j], [-3.25 + 5.75j]])
		tf.abs(x)  # [5.25594902, 6.60492229]
		```
		
		Args:
		  x: A `Tensor` or `SparseTensor` of type `float16`, `float32`, `float64`,
		    `int32`, `int64`, `complex64` or `complex128`.
		  name: A name for the operation (optional).
		
		Returns:
		  A `Tensor` or `SparseTensor` the same size and type as `x` with absolute
		    values.
		  Note, for `complex64` or `complex128` input, the returned `Tensor` will be
		    of type `float32` or `float64`, respectively.

		Returns the element-wise sum of a list of tensors.
		
		Optionally, pass `shape` and `tensor_dtype` for shape and type checking,

		`tf.math.accumulate_n` performs the same operation as `tf.add_n`, but does not
		wait for all of its inputs to be ready before beginning to sum. This can
		save memory if inputs are ready at different times, since minimum temporary
