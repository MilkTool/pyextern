		Parses `Example` protos into a `dict` of tensors.
		
		Parses a number of serialized [`Example`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/example/example.proto)
		protos given in `serialized`. We refer to `serialized` as a batch with
		`batch_size` many entries of individual `Example` protos.
		
		`example_names` may contain descriptive names for the corresponding serialized
		protos. These may be useful for debugging purposes, but they have no effect on
		the output. If not `None`, `example_names` must be the same length as
		`serialized`.
		
		This op parses serialized examples into a dictionary mapping keys to `Tensor`
		and `SparseTensor` objects. `features` is a dict from keys to `VarLenFeature`,
		`SparseFeature`, and `FixedLenFeature` objects. Each `VarLenFeature`
		and `SparseFeature` is mapped to a `SparseTensor`, and each
		`FixedLenFeature` is mapped to a `Tensor`.
		
		Each `VarLenFeature` maps to a `SparseTensor` of the specified type
		representing a ragged matrix. Its indices are `[batch, index]` where `batch`
		identifies the example in `serialized`, and `index` is the value's index in
		the list of values associated with that feature and example.
		
		Each `SparseFeature` maps to a `SparseTensor` of the specified type
		representing a Tensor of `dense_shape` `[batch_size] + SparseFeature.size`.
		Its `values` come from the feature in the examples with key `value_key`.
		A `values[i]` comes from a position `k` in the feature of an example at batch
		entry `batch`. This positional information is recorded in `indices[i]` as
		`[batch, index_0, index_1, ...]` where `index_j` is the `k-th` value of
		the feature in the example at with key `SparseFeature.index_key[j]`.
		In other words, we split the indices (except the first index indicating the
		batch entry) of a `SparseTensor` by dimension into different features of the
		`Example`. Due to its complexity a `VarLenFeature` should be preferred over a
		`SparseFeature` whenever possible.
		
		Each `FixedLenFeature` `df` maps to a `Tensor` of the specified type (or
		`tf.float32` if not specified) and shape `(serialized.size(),) + df.shape`.
		
		`FixedLenFeature` entries with a `default_value` are optional. With no default
		value, we will fail if that `Feature` is missing from any example in
		`serialized`.
		
		Each `FixedLenSequenceFeature` `df` maps to a `Tensor` of the specified type
		(or `tf.float32` if not specified) and shape
		`(serialized.size(), None) + df.shape`.
		All examples in `serialized` will be padded with `default_value` along the
		second dimension.
		
		Examples:
		
		For example, if one expects a `tf.float32` `VarLenFeature` `ft` and three
		serialized `Example`s are provided:
		
		```
		serialized = [
		  features
		    { feature { key: "ft" value { float_list { value: [1.0, 2.0] } } } },
		  features
		    { feature []},
		  features
		    { feature { key: "ft" value { float_list { value: [3.0] } } }
		]
		```
		
		then the output will look like:
		
		```python
		{"ft": SparseTensor(indices=[[0, 0], [0, 1], [2, 0]],
		                    values=[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
		                    dense_shape=(3, 2)) }
		```
		
		If instead a `FixedLenSequenceFeature` with `default_value = -1.0` and
		`shape=[]` is used then the output will look like:
		
		```python
		{"ft": [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, -1.0]]}
		```
		
		Given two `Example` input protos in `serialized`:
		
		```
		[
		  features {
		    feature { key: "kw" value { bytes_list { value: [ "knit", "big" ] } } }
		    feature { key: "gps" value { float_list { value: [] } } }
		  },
		  features {
		    feature { key: "kw" value { bytes_list { value: [ "emmy" ] } } }
		    feature { key: "dank" value { int64_list { value: [ 42 ] } } }
		    feature { key: "gps" value { } }
		  }
		]
		```
		
		And arguments
		
		```
		example_names: ["input0", "input1"],
		features: {
		    "kw": VarLenFeature(tf.string),
		    "dank": VarLenFeature(tf.int64),
		    "gps": VarLenFeature(tf.float32),
		}
		```
		
		Then the output is a dictionary:
		
		```python
		{
		  "kw": SparseTensor(
		      indices=[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0]],
		      values=["knit", "big", "emmy"]
		      dense_shape=[2, 2]),
		  "dank": SparseTensor(
		      indices=[[1, 0]],
		      values=[42],
		      dense_shape=[2, 1]),
		  "gps": SparseTensor(
		      indices=[],
		      values=[],
		      dense_shape=[2, 0]),
		}
		```
		
		For dense results in two serialized `Example`s:
		
		```
		[
		  features {
		    feature { key: "age" value { int64_list { value: [ 0 ] } } }
		    feature { key: "gender" value { bytes_list { value: [ "f" ] } } }
		   },
		   features {
		    feature { key: "age" value { int64_list { value: [] } } }
		    feature { key: "gender" value { bytes_list { value: [ "f" ] } } }
		  }
		]
		```
		
		We can use arguments:
		
		```
		example_names: ["input0", "input1"],
		features: {
		    "age": FixedLenFeature([], dtype=tf.int64, default_value=-1),
		    "gender": FixedLenFeature([], dtype=tf.string),
		}
		```
		
		And the expected output is:
		
		```python
		{
		  "age": [[0], [-1]],
		  "gender": [["f"], ["f"]],
		}
		```
		
		An alternative to `VarLenFeature` to obtain a `SparseTensor` is
		`SparseFeature`. For example, given two `Example` input protos in
		`serialized`:
		
		```
		[
		  features {
		    feature { key: "val" value { float_list { value: [ 0.5, -1.0 ] } } }
		    feature { key: "ix" value { int64_list { value: [ 3, 20 ] } } }
		  },
		  features {
		    feature { key: "val" value { float_list { value: [ 0.0 ] } } }
		    feature { key: "ix" value { int64_list { value: [ 42 ] } } }
		  }
		]
		```
		
		And arguments
		
		```
		example_names: ["input0", "input1"],
		features: {
		    "sparse": SparseFeature(
		        index_key="ix", value_key="val", dtype=tf.float32, size=100),
		}
		```
		
		Then the output is a dictionary:
		
		```python
		{
		  "sparse": SparseTensor(
		      indices=[[0, 3], [0, 20], [1, 42]],
		      values=[0.5, -1.0, 0.0]
		      dense_shape=[2, 100]),
		}

		Parses a batch of `SequenceExample` protos.
		
		Parses a vector of serialized
		[`SequenceExample`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/example/example.proto)
		protos given in `serialized`.
		
		This op parses serialized sequence examples into a tuple of dictionaries
		mapping keys to `Tensor` and `SparseTensor` objects respectively.
		The first dictionary contains mappings for keys appearing in
		`context_features`, and the second dictionary contains mappings for keys
		appearing in `sequence_features`.
		
		At least one of `context_features` and `sequence_features` must be provided
		and non-empty.
		
		The `context_features` keys are associated with a `SequenceExample` as a
		whole, independent of time / frame.  In contrast, the `sequence_features` keys
		provide a way to access variable-length data within the `FeatureList` section
		of the `SequenceExample` proto.  While the shapes of `context_features` values
		are fixed with respect to frame, the frame dimension (the first dimension)
		of `sequence_features` values may vary between `SequenceExample` protos,
		and even between `feature_list` keys within the same `SequenceExample`.
		
		`context_features` contains `VarLenFeature` and `FixedLenFeature` objects.
		Each `VarLenFeature` is mapped to a `SparseTensor`, and each `FixedLenFeature`
		is mapped to a `Tensor`, of the specified type, shape, and default value.
		
		`sequence_features` contains `VarLenFeature` and `FixedLenSequenceFeature`
		objects. Each `VarLenFeature` is mapped to a `SparseTensor`, and each
		`FixedLenSequenceFeature` is mapped to a `Tensor`, each of the specified type.
		The shape will be `(B,T,) + df.dense_shape` for `FixedLenSequenceFeature`
		`df`, where `B` is the batch size, and `T` is the length of the associated
		`FeatureList` in the `SequenceExample`. For instance,
		`FixedLenSequenceFeature([])` yields a scalar 2-D `Tensor` of static shape
		`[None, None]` and dynamic shape `[B, T]`, while
		`FixedLenSequenceFeature([k])` (for `int k >= 1`) yields a 3-D matrix `Tensor`
		of static shape `[None, None, k]` and dynamic shape `[B, T, k]`.
		
		Like the input, the resulting output tensors have a batch dimension. This
		means that the original per-example shapes of `VarLenFeature`s and
		`FixedLenSequenceFeature`s can be lost. To handle that situation, this op also
		provides dicts of shape tensors as part of the output. There is one dict for
		the context features, and one for the feature_list features. Context features
		of type `FixedLenFeature`s will not be present, since their shapes are already
		known by the caller. In situations where the input 'FixedLenFeature`s are of
		different lengths across examples, the shorter examples will be padded with
		default datatype values: 0 for numeric types, and the empty string for string
		types.
		
		Each `SparseTensor` corresponding to `sequence_features` represents a ragged
		vector.  Its indices are `[time, index]`, where `time` is the `FeatureList`
		entry and `index` is the value's index in the list of values associated with
		that time.
		
		`FixedLenFeature` entries with a `default_value` and `FixedLenSequenceFeature`
		entries with `allow_missing=True` are optional; otherwise, we will fail if
		that `Feature` or `FeatureList` is missing from any example in `serialized`.
		
		`example_name` may contain a descriptive name for the corresponding serialized
		proto. This may be useful for debugging purposes, but it has no effect on the
		output. If not `None`, `example_name` must be a scalar.
		
		Args:
		  serialized: A vector (1-D Tensor) of type string containing binary
		    serialized `SequenceExample` protos.
		  context_features: A `dict` mapping feature keys to `FixedLenFeature` or
