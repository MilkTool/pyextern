	/**
		Clone any `Model` instance.
		
		Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
		except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
		of sharing the weights of the existing layers.
		
		Arguments:
		    model: Instance of `Model`
		        (could be a functional model or a Sequential model).
		    input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
		        to build the model upon. If not provided,
		        placeholders will be created.
		
		Returns:
		    An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
		    of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
		    using newly instantiated weights.
		
		Raises:
		    ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.

		Loads a model saved via `save_model`.
		
		Arguments:
		    filepath: One of the following:
		        - String, path to the saved model
		        - `h5py.File` object from which to load the model
		    custom_objects: Optional dictionary mapping names
		        (strings) to custom classes or functions to be
		        considered during deserialization.
		    compile: Boolean, whether to compile the model
		        after loading.
		
		Returns:
		    A Keras model instance. If an optimizer was found
		    as part of the saved model, the model is already
		    compiled. Otherwise, the model is uncompiled and
		    a warning will be displayed. When `compile` is set
		    to False, the compilation is omitted without any
		    warning.
		
		Raises:
		    ImportError: if h5py is not available.
		    ValueError: In case of an invalid savefile.

		        considered during deserialization.

		Saves a model to a HDF5 file.
		
		The saved model contains:
		    - the model's configuration (topology)
		    - the model's weights
		    - the model's optimizer's state (if any)
		
		Thus the saved model can be reinstantiated in
		the exact same state, without any of the code
		used for model definition or training.
		
		Arguments:
		    model: Keras model instance to be saved.
		    filepath: One of the following:
		        - String, path where to save the model
		        - `h5py.File` object where to save the model
		    overwrite: Whether we should overwrite any existing
		        model at the target location, or instead
		        ask the user with a manual prompt.
		    include_optimizer: If True, save optimizer's state together.
		
		Raises:
		    ImportError: if h5py is not available.
