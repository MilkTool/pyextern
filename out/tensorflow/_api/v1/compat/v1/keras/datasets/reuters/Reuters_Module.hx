	/**
		Loads the Reuters newswire classification dataset.
		
		Arguments:
		    path: where to cache the data (relative to `~/.keras/dataset`).
		    num_words: max number of words to include. Words are ranked
		        by how often they occur (in the training set) and only
		        the most frequent words are kept
		    skip_top: skip the top N most frequently occurring words
		        (which may not be informative).
		    maxlen: truncate sequences after this length.
		    test_split: Fraction of the dataset to be used as test data.
		    seed: random seed for sample shuffling.
		    start_char: The start of a sequence will be marked with this character.
		        Set to 1 because 0 is usually the padding character.
		    oov_char: words that were cut out because of the `num_words`
		        or `skip_top` limit will be replaced with this character.
		    index_from: index actual words with this index and higher.
		    **kwargs: Used for backwards compatibility.
		
		Returns:
		    Tuple of Numpy arrays: `(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)`.
		
		Note that the 'out of vocabulary' character is only used for
		words that were present in the training set but are not included
		because they're not making the `num_words` cut here.
		Words that were not seen in the training set but are in the test set
		have simply been skipped.
