		A transformation that buckets elements in a `Dataset` by length.
		
		Elements of the `Dataset` are grouped together by length and then are padded

		This is useful for sequence tasks in which the elements have variable length.
		Grouping together elements that have similar lengths reduces the total
		fraction of padding in a batch which increases training step efficiency.
		
		Args:
		  element_length_func: function from element in `Dataset` to `tf.int32`,

		  bucket_boundaries: `list<int>`, upper length boundaries of the buckets.
		  bucket_batch_sizes: `list<int>`, batch size per bucket. Length should be

		  padded_shapes: Nested structure of `tf.TensorShape` to pass to
		    `tf.data.Dataset.padded_batch`. If not provided, will use
		    `dataset.output_shapes`, which will result in variable length dimensions
		    being padded out to the maximum length in each batch.
		  padding_values: Values to pad with, passed to
		    `tf.data.Dataset.padded_batch`. Defaults to padding with 0.
		  pad_to_bucket_boundary: bool, if `False`, will pad dimensions with unknown
		    size to maximum length in batch. If `True`, will pad dimensions with

		Creates a `Dataset` that includes only 1/`num_shards` of this dataset.
		
		This dataset operator is very useful when running distributed training, as

		```python
		d = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(FLAGS.input_file)
		d = d.apply(tf.data.experimental.naive_shard(FLAGS.num_workers,

		- Generally it is best if the shard operator is used early in the dataset

		Args:
		  file_pattern: List of files or patterns of file paths containing CSV
		    records. See `tf.gfile.Glob` for pattern rules.
		  batch_size: An int representing the number of records to combine
		    in a single batch.
		  column_names: An optional list of strings that corresponds to the CSV
		    columns, in order. One per column of the input record. If this is not
		    provided, infers the column names from the first row of the records.
		    These names will be the keys of the features dict of each dataset element.
		  column_defaults: A optional list of default values for the CSV fields. One
		    item per selected column of the input record. Each item in the list is
		    either a valid CSV dtype (float32, float64, int32, int64, or string), or a
		    `Tensor` with one of the aforementioned types. The tensor can either be
		    a scalar default value (if the column is optional), or an empty tensor (if
		    the column is required). If a dtype is provided instead of a tensor, the
		    column is also treated as required. If this list is not provided, tries
		    to infer types based on reading the first num_rows_for_inference rows of
		    files specified, and assumes all columns are optional, defaulting to `0`
		    for numeric values and `""` for string values. If both this and
		    `select_columns` are specified, these must have the same lengths, and
		    `column_defaults` is assumed to be sorted in order of increasing column
		    index.
		  label_name: A optional string corresponding to the label column. If
		    provided, the data for this column is returned as a separate `Tensor` from
		    the features dictionary, so that the dataset complies with the format
		    expected by a `tf.Estimator.train` or `tf.Estimator.evaluate` input
		    function.
		  select_columns: An optional list of integer indices or string column
		    names, that specifies a subset of columns of CSV data to select. If
		    column names are provided, these must correspond to names provided in
		    `column_names` or inferred from the file header lines. When this argument
		    is specified, only a subset of CSV columns will be parsed and returned,
		    corresponding to the columns specified. Using this results in faster
		    parsing and lower memory usage. If both this and `column_defaults` are
		    specified, these must have the same lengths, and `column_defaults` is
		    assumed to be sorted in order of increasing column index.
		  field_delim: An optional `string`. Defaults to `","`. Char delimiter to
		    separate fields in a record.
		  use_quote_delim: An optional bool. Defaults to `True`. If false, treats
		    double quotation marks as regular characters inside of the string fields.
		  na_value: Additional string to recognize as NA/NaN.
		  header: A bool that indicates whether the first rows of provided CSV files
		    correspond to header lines with column names, and should not be included
		    in the data.
		  num_epochs: An int specifying the number of times this dataset is repeated.
		    If None, cycles through the dataset forever.
		  shuffle: A bool that indicates whether the input should be shuffled.
		  shuffle_buffer_size: Buffer size to use for shuffling. A large buffer size
		    ensures better shuffling, but increases memory usage and startup time.
		  shuffle_seed: Randomization seed to use for shuffling.
		  prefetch_buffer_size: An int specifying the number of feature
		    batches to prefetch for performance improvement. Recommended value is the
		    number of batches consumed per training step. Defaults to auto-tune.
		
		  num_parallel_reads: Number of threads used to read CSV records from files.
		    If >1, the results will be interleaved.
		  sloppy: If `True`, reading performance will be improved at
		    the cost of non-deterministic ordering. If `False`, the order of elements
		    produced is deterministic prior to shuffling (elements are still
		    randomized if `shuffle=True`. Note that if the seed is set, then order
		    of elements after shuffling is deterministic). Defaults to `False`.
		  num_rows_for_inference: Number of rows of a file to use for type inference
		    if record_defaults is not provided. If None, reads all the rows of all
		    the files. Defaults to 100.
		  compression_type: (Optional.) A `tf.string` scalar evaluating to one of
		    `""` (no compression), `"ZLIB"`, or `"GZIP"`. Defaults to no compression.
		
		Returns:
		  A dataset, where each element is a (features, labels) tuple that corresponds
		  to a batch of `batch_size` CSV rows. The features dictionary maps feature
		  column names to `Tensor`s containing the corresponding column data, and

		A parallel version of the `Dataset.interleave()` transformation.
		
		`parallel_interleave()` maps `map_func` across its input to produce nested
		datasets, and outputs their elements interleaved. Unlike
		`tf.data.Dataset.interleave`, it gets elements from `cycle_length` nested
		datasets in parallel, which increases the throughput, especially in the
		presence of stragglers. Furthermore, the `sloppy` argument can be used to
		improve performance, by relaxing the requirement that the outputs are produced
		in a deterministic order, and allowing the implementation to skip over nested
		datasets whose elements are not readily available when requested.
		
		Example usage:
		
		```python
		# Preprocess 4 files concurrently.
		filenames = tf.data.Dataset.list_files("/path/to/data/train*.tfrecords")
		dataset = filenames.apply(
		    tf.data.experimental.parallel_interleave(
		        lambda filename: tf.data.TFRecordDataset(filename),
		        cycle_length=4))
		```
		
		WARNING: If `sloppy` is `True`, the order of produced elements is not
		deterministic.
		
		Args:
		  map_func: A function mapping a nested structure of tensors to a `Dataset`.
		  cycle_length: The number of input `Dataset`s to interleave from in parallel.
		  block_length: The number of consecutive elements to pull from an input
		    `Dataset` before advancing to the next input `Dataset`.
		  sloppy: If false, elements are produced in deterministic order. Otherwise,
		    the implementation is allowed, for the sake of expediency, to produce
		    elements in a non-deterministic order.
		  buffer_output_elements: The number of elements each iterator being
		    interleaved should buffer (similar to the `.prefetch()` transformation for
		    each interleaved iterator).
		  prefetch_input_elements: The number of input elements to transform to
		    iterators before they are needed for interleaving.
		
		Returns:
		  A `Dataset` transformation function, which can be passed to
		  `tf.data.Dataset.apply`.
