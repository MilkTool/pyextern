		Returns a nested structure of `tf.Tensor`s representing the next element.
		
		In graph mode, you should typically call this method *once* and use its
		result as the input to another computation. A typical loop will then call
		`tf.Session.run` on the result of that computation. The loop will terminate
		when the `Iterator.get_next()` operation raises
		`tf.errors.OutOfRangeError`. The following skeleton shows how to use
		this method when building a training loop:
		
		```python
		dataset = ...  # A `tf.data.Dataset` object.
		iterator = dataset.make_initializable_iterator()
		next_element = iterator.get_next()
		
		# Build a TensorFlow graph that does something with each element.
		loss = model_function(next_element)
		optimizer = ...  # A `tf.train.Optimizer` object.
		train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)
		
		with tf.Session() as sess:
		  try:
		    while True:
		      sess.run(train_op)
		  except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:
		    pass
		```
		
		NOTE: It is legitimate to call `Iterator.get_next()` multiple times, e.g.
		when you are distributing different elements to multiple devices in a single
		step. However, a common pitfall arises when users call `Iterator.get_next()`
		in each iteration of their training loop. `Iterator.get_next()` adds ops to
		the graph, and executing each op allocates resources (including threads); as
		a consequence, invoking it in every iteration of a training loop causes
		slowdown and eventual resource exhaustion. To guard against this outcome, we
		log a warning when the number of uses crosses a fixed threshold of
		suspiciousness.
