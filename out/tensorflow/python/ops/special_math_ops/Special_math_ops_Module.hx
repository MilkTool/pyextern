	/**
		Helper for einsum() that computes the result of a two-argument einsum().
		
		Args:
		  t0: a `Tensor`
		  t0_axis_labels: a string of axis labels.  This string's length must equal
		    the rank of t0.
		  t1: a `Tensor`
		  t1_axis_labels: a string to axis labels.  This string's length must equal
		    the rank of t1.
		  axes_to_sum: set of labels of axes to be summed over
		
		Returns:
		  A `Tensor` whose elements are obtained by summing, over all axes in
		  `axes_to_sum`, the corresponding elements of `t0` and `t1`.
		
		  For example, if t0_axis_labels == 'abijk', t1_axis_labels == 'acjkl', and
		  axes_to_sum == {j,k}, this will return a tensor x where
		
		    out[a,b,c,i,l] = sum_j sum_k t0[a,b,i,j,k] * t1[a,c,j,k,l]
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: if the rank of `t0` does not match the length of
		    `t0_axis_labels`, or that of `t1` does not match the length of
		    `t1_axis_labels`.

	/**
		A generalized contraction between tensors of arbitrary dimension.
		
		This function returns a tensor whose elements are defined by `equation`,
		which is written in a shorthand form inspired by the Einstein summation
		convention.  As an example, consider multiplying two matrices
		A and B to form a matrix C.  The elements of C are given by:
		
		```
		  C[i,k] = sum_j A[i,j] * B[j,k]
		```
		
		The corresponding `equation` is:
		
		```
		  ij,jk->ik
		```
		
		In general, the `equation` is obtained from the more familiar element-wise
		equation by
		  1. removing variable names, brackets, and commas,
		  2. replacing "*" with ",",
		  3. dropping summation signs, and
		  4. moving the output to the right, and replacing "=" with "->".
		
		Many common operations can be expressed in this way.  For example:
		
		```python
		# Matrix multiplication
		>>> einsum('ij,jk->ik', m0, m1)  # output[i,k] = sum_j m0[i,j] * m1[j, k]
		
		# Dot product
		>>> einsum('i,i->', u, v)  # output = sum_i u[i]*v[i]
		
		# Outer product
		>>> einsum('i,j->ij', u, v)  # output[i,j] = u[i]*v[j]
		
		# Transpose
		>>> einsum('ij->ji', m)  # output[j,i] = m[i,j]
		
		# Batch matrix multiplication
		>>> einsum('aij,ajk->aik', s, t)  # out[a,i,k] = sum_j s[a,i,j] * t[a, j, k]
		```
		
		This function behaves like `numpy.einsum`, but does not support:
		
		* Ellipses (subscripts like `ij...,jk...->ik...`)
		* Subscripts where an axis appears more than once for a single input
		  (e.g. `ijj,k->ik`).
		
		Args:
		  equation: a `str` describing the contraction, in the same format as
		    `numpy.einsum`.
		  *inputs: the inputs to contract (each one a `Tensor`), whose shapes should
		    be consistent with `equation`.
		  name: A name for the operation (optional).
		
		Returns:
		  The contracted `Tensor`, with shape determined by `equation`.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: If
		    - the format of `equation` is incorrect,
		    - the number of inputs implied by `equation` does not match `len(inputs)`,
		    - an axis appears in the output subscripts but not in any of the inputs,
		    - the number of dimensions of an input differs from the number of
		      indices in its subscript, or
		    - the input shapes are inconsistent along a particular axis.

		Computes \\(ln(|Beta(x)|)\\), reducing along the last dimension.
		
		Given one-dimensional `z = [z_0,...,z_{K-1}]`, we define
		
		$$Beta(z) = \prod_j Gamma(z_j) / Gamma(\sum_j z_j)$$
		
		And for `n + 1` dimensional `x` with shape `[N1, ..., Nn, K]`, we define
		$$lbeta(x)[i1, ..., in] = Log(|Beta(x[i1, ..., in, :])|)$$.
		
		In other words, the last dimension is treated as the `z` vector.
		
		Note that if `z = [u, v]`, then
		\\(Beta(z) = int_0^1 t^{u-1} (1 - t)^{v-1} dt\\), which defines the
		traditional bivariate beta function.
		
		If the last dimension is empty, we follow the convention that the sum over
		the empty set is zero, and the product is one.
		
		Args:
		  x: A rank `n + 1` `Tensor`, `n >= 0` with type `float`, or `double`.
		  name: A name for the operation (optional).
		
		Returns:
