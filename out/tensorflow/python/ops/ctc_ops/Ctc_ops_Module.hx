		Performs beam search decoding on the logits given in input.
		
		**Note** The `ctc_greedy_decoder` is a special case of the
		`ctc_beam_search_decoder` with `top_paths=1` and `beam_width=1` (but
		that decoder is faster for this special case).
		
		If `merge_repeated` is `True`, merge repeated classes in the output beams.
		This means that if consecutive entries in a beam are the same,
		only the first of these is emitted.  That is, when the sequence is
		`A B B * B * B` (where '*' is the blank label), the return value is:
		
		  * `A B` if `merge_repeated = True`.
		  * `A B B B` if `merge_repeated = False`.
		
		Args:
		  inputs: 3-D `float` `Tensor`, size
		    `[max_time x batch_size x num_classes]`.  The logits.
		  sequence_length: 1-D `int32` vector containing sequence lengths,
		    having size `[batch_size]`.
		  beam_width: An int scalar >= 0 (beam search beam width).
		  top_paths: An int scalar >= 0, <= beam_width (controls output size).
		  merge_repeated: Boolean.  Default: True.
		
		Returns:
		  A tuple `(decoded, log_probabilities)` where
		  decoded: A list of length top_paths, where `decoded[j]`
		    is a `SparseTensor` containing the decoded outputs:

		      The vector stores the decoded classes for beam j.
		    `decoded[j].dense_shape`: Shape vector, size `(2)`.
		      The shape values are: `[batch_size, max_decoded_length[j]]`.
		  log_probability: A `float` matrix `(batch_size x top_paths)` containing
		      sequence log-probabilities.

		Computes the CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) Loss.
		
		This op implements the CTC loss as presented in the article:
		
		[A. Graves, S. Fernandez, F. Gomez, J. Schmidhuber.
		Connectionist Temporal Classification: Labeling Unsegmented Sequence Data
		with Recurrent Neural Networks. ICML 2006, Pittsburgh, USA,
		pp. 369-376.](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/icml_2006.pdf)
		
		Input requirements:
		
		```
		sequence_length(b) <= time for all b
		
		max(labels.indices(labels.indices[:, 1] == b, 2))
		  <= sequence_length(b) for all b.
		```
		
		Notes:
		
		This class performs the softmax operation for you, so inputs should
		be e.g. linear projections of outputs by an LSTM.
		
		The `inputs` Tensor's innermost dimension size, `num_classes`, represents
		`num_labels + 1` classes, where num_labels is the number of true labels, and
		the largest value `(num_classes - 1)` is reserved for the blank label.
		
		For example, for a vocabulary containing 3 labels `[a, b, c]`,
		`num_classes = 4` and the labels indexing is `{a: 0, b: 1, c: 2, blank: 3}`.
		
		Regarding the arguments `preprocess_collapse_repeated` and
		`ctc_merge_repeated`:
		
		If `preprocess_collapse_repeated` is True, then a preprocessing step runs
		before loss calculation, wherein repeated labels passed to the loss
		are merged into single labels.  This is useful if the training labels come
		from, e.g., forced alignments and therefore have unnecessary repetitions.
		
		If `ctc_merge_repeated` is set False, then deep within the CTC calculation,
		repeated non-blank labels will not be merged and are interpreted
		as individual labels.  This is a simplified (non-standard) version of CTC.
		
		Here is a table of the (roughly) expected first order behavior:
		
		* `preprocess_collapse_repeated=False`, `ctc_merge_repeated=True`
		
		  Classical CTC behavior: Outputs true repeated classes with blanks in
		  between, and can also output repeated classes with no blanks in
		  between that need to be collapsed by the decoder.
		
		* `preprocess_collapse_repeated=True`, `ctc_merge_repeated=False`
		
		  Never learns to output repeated classes, as they are collapsed
		  in the input labels before training.
		
		* `preprocess_collapse_repeated=False`, `ctc_merge_repeated=False`
		
		  Outputs repeated classes with blanks in between, but generally does not
		  require the decoder to collapse/merge repeated classes.
		
		* `preprocess_collapse_repeated=True`, `ctc_merge_repeated=True`
		
		  Untested.  Very likely will not learn to output repeated classes.
		
		The `ignore_longer_outputs_than_inputs` option allows to specify the behavior
		of the CTCLoss when dealing with sequences that have longer outputs than
		inputs. If true, the CTCLoss will simply return zero gradient for those
		items, otherwise an InvalidArgument error is returned, stopping training.
		
		Args:
		  labels: An `int32` `SparseTensor`.
		    `labels.indices[i, :] == [b, t]` means `labels.values[i]` stores
		    the id for (batch b, time t).
		    `labels.values[i]` must take on values in `[0, num_labels)`.
		    See `core/ops/ctc_ops.cc` for more details.
		  inputs: 3-D `float` `Tensor`.
		    If time_major == False, this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
		      `[batch_size, max_time, num_classes]`.
		    If time_major == True (default), this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
		      `[max_time, batch_size, num_classes]`.
		    The logits.
		  sequence_length: 1-D `int32` vector, size `[batch_size]`.
		    The sequence lengths.
		  preprocess_collapse_repeated: Boolean.  Default: False.
		    If True, repeated labels are collapsed prior to the CTC calculation.
		  ctc_merge_repeated: Boolean.  Default: True.
		  ignore_longer_outputs_than_inputs: Boolean. Default: False.
		    If True, sequences with longer outputs than inputs will be ignored.
		  time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` Tensors.
		    If True, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[max_time, batch_size,
		    num_classes]`.
		    If False, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[batch_size, max_time,
		    num_classes]`.
		    Using `time_major = True` (default) is a bit more efficient because it
		    avoids transposes at the beginning of the ctc_loss calculation.  However,
		    most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by this function also accepts
		    inputs in batch-major form.
		
		Returns:
		  A 1-D `float` `Tensor`, size `[batch]`, containing the negative log
		    probabilities.
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: if labels is not a `SparseTensor`.
