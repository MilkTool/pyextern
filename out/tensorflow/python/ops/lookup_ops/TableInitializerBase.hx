		Returns a dictionary of values to checkpoint with this object.
		
		Keys in the returned dictionary are local to this object and in a separate
		namespace from dependencies. Values may either be `SaveableObject` factories
		or variables easily converted to `SaveableObject`s (as in `tf.train.Saver`'s
		`var_list` constructor argument).
		
		`SaveableObjects` have a name set, which Checkpointable needs to generate
		itself. So rather than returning `SaveableObjects` directly, this method
		should return a dictionary of callables which take `name` arguments and
		return `SaveableObjects` with that name.
		
		If this object may also be passed to the global-name-based `tf.train.Saver`,
		the returned callables should have a default value for their name argument
		(i.e. be callable with no arguments).
		
		Returned values must be saved only by this object; if any value may be
		shared, it should instead be a dependency. For example, variable objects
		save their own values with the key `VARIABLE_VALUE_KEY`, but objects which
		reference variables simply add a dependency.
		
		Returns:
		  The dictionary mapping attribute names to `SaveableObject` factories
		  described above. For example:

		`checkpointable` and its dependencies are restored. The restorations are
		considered fulfilled and so are deleted.
		
		`_track_checkpointable` is more appropriate for adding a
		normal/unconditional dependency, and includes handling for deferred
		restorations. This method allows objects such as `Optimizer` to use the same
		restoration logic while managing conditional dependencies themselves, by
		overriding `_checkpoint_dependencies` and `_lookup_dependency` to change the
		object's dependencies based on the context it is saved/restored in (a single
		optimizer instance can have state associated with multiple graphs).
		
		Args:
		  name: The name of the dependency within this object (`self`), used to
		    match `checkpointable` with values saved in a checkpoint.
