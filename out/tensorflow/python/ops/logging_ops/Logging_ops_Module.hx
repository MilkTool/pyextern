	/**
		Prints a list of tensors. (deprecated)
		
		Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed after 2018-08-20.
		Instructions for updating:
		Use tf.print instead of tf.Print. Note that tf.print returns a no-output operator that directly prints the output. Outside of defuns or eager mode, this operator will not be executed unless it is directly specified in session.run or used as a control dependency for other operators. This is only a concern in graph mode. Below is an example of how to ensure tf.print executes in graph mode:
		```python
		    sess = tf.Session()
		    with sess.as_default():
		        tensor = tf.range(10)
		        print_op = tf.print(tensor)
		        with tf.control_dependencies([print_op]):
		          out = tf.add(tensor, tensor)
		        sess.run(out)
		    ```
		Additionally, to use tf.print in python 2.7, users must make sure to import
		the following:
		
		  `from __future__ import print_function`
		
		
		This is an identity op (behaves like `tf.identity`) with the side effect
		of printing `data` when evaluating.
		
		Note: This op prints to the standard error. It is not currently compatible
		  with jupyter notebook (printing to the notebook *server's* output, not into
		  the notebook).
		
		Args:
		  input_: A tensor passed through this op.
		  data: A list of tensors to print out when op is evaluated.
		  message: A string, prefix of the error message.
		  first_n: Only log `first_n` number of times. Negative numbers log always;
		           this is the default.
		  summarize: Only print this many entries of each tensor. If None, then a
		             maximum of 3 elements are printed per input tensor.
		  name: A name for the operation (optional).
		
		Returns:
		  A `Tensor`. Has the same type and contents as `input_`.

		*  3: `tensor` is interpreted as RGB.
		*  4: `tensor` is interpreted as RGBA.
		
		The images have the same number of channels as the input tensor. For float
		input, the values are normalized one image at a time to fit in the range
		`[0, 255]`.  `uint8` values are unchanged.  The op uses two different
		normalization algorithms:
		
		*  If the input values are all positive, they are rescaled so the largest one
		   is 255.
		
		*  If any input value is negative, the values are shifted so input value 0.0
		   is at 127.  They are then rescaled so that either the smallest value is 0,
		   or the largest one is 255.
		
		The `tag` argument is a scalar `Tensor` of type `string`.  It is used to
		build the `tag` of the summary values:
		
		*  If `max_images` is 1, the summary value tag is '*tag* /image'.
		*  If `max_images` is greater than 1, the summary value tags are

		Example:

		  tensor = tf.range(10)
		  tf.print(tensor, output_stream=sys.stderr)
		  ```

		  tf.enable_eager_execution()
		  tensor = tf.range(10)
		  tf.print("tensors:", tensor, {2: tensor * 2}, output_stream=sys.stdout)
		  ```
		  (This prints "tensors: [0 1 2 ... 7 8 9] {2: [0 2 4 ... 14 16 18]}" to
		  sys.stdout)
		
		  Usage in a defun:
		  ```python
		  tf.enable_eager_execution()
		
		  @tf.contrib.eager.defun
		  def f():
		      tensor = tf.range(10)
		      tf.print(tensor, output_stream=sys.stderr)
		      return tensor
		
		  range_tensor = f()
		  ```
		  (This prints "[0 1 2 ... 7 8 9]" to sys.stderr)
		
		  Usage when constructing graphs:

		      print_op = tf.print("tensors:", tensor, {2: tensor * 2},

		Note: This op is only partially compatible with Jupyter notebooks and colabs.

		Args:
		  *inputs: Positional arguments that are the inputs to print. Inputs in the
		    printed output will be separated by spaces. Inputs may be python
