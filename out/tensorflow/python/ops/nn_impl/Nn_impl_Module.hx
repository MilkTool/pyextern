		Computes sampled output training logits and labels suitable for implementing
		e.g. noise-contrastive estimation (see nce_loss) or sampled softmax (see
		sampled_softmax_loss).
		
		Note: In the case where num_true > 1, we assign to each target class

		  biases: A `Tensor` of shape `[num_classes]`.  The (possibly-partitioned)
		      class biases.
		  labels: A `Tensor` of type `int64` and shape `[batch_size,
		      num_true]`. The target classes.  Note that this format differs from
		      the `labels` argument of `nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2`.

		  subtract_log_q: A `bool`.  whether to subtract the log expected count of
		      the labels in the sample to get the logits of the true labels.
		      Default is True.  Turn off for Negative Sampling.

		      where a sampled class equals one of the target classes.  Default is
		      False.

		A common use case is to use this method for training, and calculate the full

		the target probability 1 / `num_true` so that the target probabilities
		sum to 1 per-example.
		
		Note: It would be useful to allow a variable number of target classes per
		example.  We hope to provide this functionality in a future release.
		For now, if you have a variable number of target classes, you can pad them
		out to a constant number by either repeating them or by padding

	/**
		2-D convolution with separable filters.
		
		Performs a depthwise convolution that acts separately on channels followed by
		a pointwise convolution that mixes channels.  Note that this is separability
		between dimensions `[1, 2]` and `3`, not spatial separability between
		dimensions `1` and `2`.
		
		In detail,
		
		    output[b, i, j, k] = sum_{di, dj, q, r}
		        input[b, strides[1] * i + di, strides[2] * j + dj, q] *
		        depthwise_filter[di, dj, q, r] *
		        pointwise_filter[0, 0, q * channel_multiplier + r, k]
		
		`strides` controls the strides for the depthwise convolution only, since
		the pointwise convolution has implicit strides of `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.  Must have
		`strides[0] = strides[3] = 1`.  For the most common case of the same
		horizontal and vertical strides, `strides = [1, stride, stride, 1]`.
		If any value in `rate` is greater than 1, we perform atrous depthwise
		convolution, in which case all values in the `strides` tensor must be equal
		to 1.
		
		Args:
		  input: 4-D `Tensor` with shape according to `data_format`.
		  depthwise_filter: 4-D `Tensor` with shape
		    `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, channel_multiplier]`.
		    Contains `in_channels` convolutional filters of depth 1.
		  pointwise_filter: 4-D `Tensor` with shape
		    `[1, 1, channel_multiplier * in_channels, out_channels]`.  Pointwise
		    filter to mix channels after `depthwise_filter` has convolved spatially.
		  strides: 1-D of size 4.  The strides for the depthwise convolution for
		    each dimension of `input`.
		  padding: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`.  The padding algorithm.
		    See the "returns" section of `tf.nn.convolution` for details.
		  rate: 1-D of size 2. The dilation rate in which we sample input values
		    across the `height` and `width` dimensions in atrous convolution. If it is
		    greater than 1, then all values of strides must be 1.
		  name: A name for this operation (optional).
		  data_format: The data format for input. Either "NHWC" (default) or "NCHW".
		
		Returns:
		  A 4-D `Tensor` with shape according to 'data_format'. For
		    example, with data_format="NHWC", shape is [batch, out_height,
		    out_width, out_channels].

		Computes sigmoid cross entropy given `logits`.
		
		Measures the probability error in discrete classification tasks in which each
		class is independent and not mutually exclusive.  For instance, one could
		perform multilabel classification where a picture can contain both an elephant
		and a dog at the same time.
		
		For brevity, let `x = logits`, `z = labels`.  The logistic loss is
		
		      z * -log(sigmoid(x)) + (1 - z) * -log(1 - sigmoid(x))
		    = z * -log(1 / (1 + exp(-x))) + (1 - z) * -log(exp(-x) / (1 + exp(-x)))
		    = z * log(1 + exp(-x)) + (1 - z) * (-log(exp(-x)) + log(1 + exp(-x)))
		    = z * log(1 + exp(-x)) + (1 - z) * (x + log(1 + exp(-x))
		    = (1 - z) * x + log(1 + exp(-x))
		    = x - x * z + log(1 + exp(-x))
		
		For x < 0, to avoid overflow in exp(-x), we reformulate the above
		
		      x - x * z + log(1 + exp(-x))
		    = log(exp(x)) - x * z + log(1 + exp(-x))
		    = - x * z + log(1 + exp(x))
		
		Hence, to ensure stability and avoid overflow, the implementation uses this
		equivalent formulation
		
		    max(x, 0) - x * z + log(1 + exp(-abs(x)))
		
		`logits` and `labels` must have the same type and shape.
		
		Args:
		  _sentinel: Used to prevent positional parameters. Internal, do not use.

		  logits: A `Tensor` of type `float32` or `float64`.

		Args:

		Computes a weighted cross entropy.
		
		This is like `sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits()` except that `pos_weight`,
		allows one to trade off recall and precision by up- or down-weighting the
		cost of a positive error relative to a negative error.
		
		The usual cross-entropy cost is defined as:
		
		    targets * -log(sigmoid(logits)) +
		        (1 - targets) * -log(1 - sigmoid(logits))
		
		A value `pos_weights > 1` decreases the false negative count, hence increasing
		the recall.
		Conversely setting `pos_weights < 1` decreases the false positive count and
		increases the precision.
		This can be seen from the fact that `pos_weight` is introduced as a
		multiplicative coefficient for the positive targets term
		in the loss expression:
		
		    targets * -log(sigmoid(logits)) * pos_weight +
		        (1 - targets) * -log(1 - sigmoid(logits))
		
		For brevity, let `x = logits`, `z = targets`, `q = pos_weight`.
		The loss is:
		
		      qz * -log(sigmoid(x)) + (1 - z) * -log(1 - sigmoid(x))
		    = qz * -log(1 / (1 + exp(-x))) + (1 - z) * -log(exp(-x) / (1 + exp(-x)))
		    = qz * log(1 + exp(-x)) + (1 - z) * (-log(exp(-x)) + log(1 + exp(-x)))
		    = qz * log(1 + exp(-x)) + (1 - z) * (x + log(1 + exp(-x))
		    = (1 - z) * x + (qz +  1 - z) * log(1 + exp(-x))
		    = (1 - z) * x + (1 + (q - 1) * z) * log(1 + exp(-x))
		
		Setting `l = (1 + (q - 1) * z)`, to ensure stability and avoid overflow,
		the implementation uses
		
		    (1 - z) * x + l * (log(1 + exp(-abs(x))) + max(-x, 0))
