	/**
		Multiply the Hessian of `ys` wrt `xs` by `v`.
		
		This is an efficient construction that uses a backprop-like approach
		to compute the product between the Hessian and another vector. The
		Hessian is usually too large to be explicitly computed or even
		represented, but this method allows us to at least multiply by it
		for the same big-O cost as backprop.
		
		Implicit Hessian-vector products are the main practical, scalable way
		of using second derivatives with neural networks. They allow us to
		do things like construct Krylov subspaces and approximate conjugate
		gradient descent.
		
		Example: if `y` = 1/2 `x`^T A `x`, then `hessian_vector_product(y,
		x, v)` will return an expression that evaluates to the same values
		as (A + A.T) `v`.
		
		Args:
		  ys: A scalar value, or a tensor or list of tensors to be summed to
		      yield a scalar.
		  xs: A list of tensors that we should construct the Hessian over.
		  v: A list of tensors, with the same shapes as xs, that we want to
		     multiply by the Hessian.
		
		Returns:
		  A list of tensors (or if the list would be length 1, a single tensor)
		  containing the product between the Hessian and `v`.
		
		Raises:
		  ValueError: `xs` and `v` have different length.

	/**
		Constructs symbolic derivatives of sum of `ys` w.r.t. x in `xs`.
		
		`ys` and `xs` are each a `Tensor` or a list of tensors.  `grad_ys`
		is a list of `Tensor`, holding the gradients received by the
		`ys`. The list must be the same length as `ys`.
		
		`gradients()` adds ops to the graph to output the derivatives of `ys` with
		respect to `xs`.  It returns a list of `Tensor` of length `len(xs)` where
		each tensor is the `sum(dy/dx)` for y in `ys`.
		
		`grad_ys` is a list of tensors of the same length as `ys` that holds
		the initial gradients for each y in `ys`.  When `grad_ys` is None,
		we fill in a tensor of '1's of the shape of y for each y in `ys`.  A
		user can provide their own initial `grad_ys` to compute the
		derivatives using a different initial gradient for each y (e.g., if
		one wanted to weight the gradient differently for each value in
		each y).
		
		`stop_gradients` is a `Tensor` or a list of tensors to be considered constant
		with respect to all `xs`. These tensors will not be backpropagated through,
		as though they had been explicitly disconnected using `stop_gradient`.  Among
		other things, this allows computation of partial derivatives as opposed to
		total derivatives. For example:
		
		```python
		a = tf.constant(0.)
		b = 2 * a
		g = tf.gradients(a + b, [a, b], stop_gradients=[a, b])
		```
		
		Here the partial derivatives `g` evaluate to `[1.0, 1.0]`, compared to the
		total derivatives `tf.gradients(a + b, [a, b])`, which take into account the
		influence of `a` on `b` and evaluate to `[3.0, 1.0]`.  Note that the above is
		equivalent to:
		
		```python
		a = tf.stop_gradient(tf.constant(0.))
		b = tf.stop_gradient(2 * a)
		g = tf.gradients(a + b, [a, b])
		```
		
		`stop_gradients` provides a way of stopping gradient after the graph has
		already been constructed, as compared to `tf.stop_gradient` which is used
		during graph construction.  When the two approaches are combined,
		backpropagation stops at both `tf.stop_gradient` nodes and nodes in
		`stop_gradients`, whichever is encountered first.
		
		All integer tensors are considered constant with respect to all `xs`, as if
		they were included in `stop_gradients`.
		
		Args:
		  ys: A `Tensor` or list of tensors to be differentiated.
		  xs: A `Tensor` or list of tensors to be used for differentiation.
		  grad_ys: Optional. A `Tensor` or list of tensors the same size as
		    `ys` and holding the gradients computed for each y in `ys`.
		  name: Optional name to use for grouping all the gradient ops together.
		    defaults to 'gradients'.
		  colocate_gradients_with_ops: If True, try colocating gradients with
		    the corresponding op.
		  gate_gradients: If True, add a tuple around the gradients returned
		    for an operations.  This avoids some race conditions.
		  aggregation_method: Specifies the method used to combine gradient terms.
		    Accepted values are constants defined in the class `AggregationMethod`.
		  stop_gradients: Optional. A `Tensor` or list of tensors not to differentiate
		    through.
		
		Returns:
		  A list of `sum(dy/dx)` for each x in `xs`.
		
		Raises:
		  LookupError: if one of the operations between `x` and `y` does not
		    have a registered gradient function.
		  ValueError: if the arguments are invalid.
		  RuntimeError: if called in Eager mode.
