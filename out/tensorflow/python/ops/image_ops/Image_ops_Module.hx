		Instructions for updating:

		Bounding box annotations are often supplied in addition to ground-truth labels
		in image recognition or object localization tasks. A common technique for
		training such a system is to randomly distort an image while preserving
		its content, i.e. *data augmentation*. This Op outputs a randomly distorted
		localization of an object, i.e. bounding box, given an `image_size`,
		`bounding_boxes` and a series of constraints.
		
		The output of this Op is a single bounding box that may be used to crop the
		original image. The output is returned as 3 tensors: `begin`, `size` and
		`bboxes`. The first 2 tensors can be fed directly into `tf.slice` to crop the
		image. The latter may be supplied to `tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes` to
		visualize
		what the bounding box looks like.
		
		Bounding boxes are supplied and returned as `[y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]`.
		The
		bounding box coordinates are floats in `[0.0, 1.0]` relative to the width and
		height of the underlying image.
		
		For example,
		
		```python
		    # Generate a single distorted bounding box.
		    begin, size, bbox_for_draw = tf.image.sample_distorted_bounding_box(
		        tf.shape(image),

		    # Employ the bounding box to distort the image.
		    distorted_image = tf.slice(image, begin, size)
		```
		
		Note that if no bounding box information is available, setting
		`use_image_if_no_bounding_boxes = true` will assume there is a single implicit
		bounding box covering the whole image. If `use_image_if_no_bounding_boxes` is

		  float64.  The image(s) must be 2x2 or larger.
		
		Returns:
		  Tensor holding edge maps for each channel. Returns a tensor with shape

		Computes SSIM index between img1 and img2.
		
		This function is based on the standard SSIM implementation from:
		Wang, Z., Bovik, A. C., Sheikh, H. R., & Simoncelli, E. P. (2004). Image
		quality assessment: from error visibility to structural similarity. IEEE
		transactions on image processing.
		
		Note: The true SSIM is only defined on grayscale.  This function does not
		perform any colorspace transform.  (If input is already YUV, then it will
		compute YUV SSIM average.)
		
		Details:
		  - 11x11 Gaussian filter of width 1.5 is used.
		  - k1 = 0.01, k2 = 0.03 as in the original paper.
		
		The image sizes must be at least 11x11 because of the filter size.
		
		Example:
		
		```python
		    # Read images from file.
		    im1 = tf.decode_png('path/to/im1.png')
		    im2 = tf.decode_png('path/to/im2.png')
		    # Compute SSIM over tf.uint8 Tensors.
		    ssim1 = tf.image.ssim(im1, im2, max_val=255)
		
		    # Compute SSIM over tf.float32 Tensors.
		    im1 = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(im1, tf.float32)
		    im2 = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(im2, tf.float32)
		    ssim2 = tf.image.ssim(im1, im2, max_val=1.0)
		    # ssim1 and ssim2 both have type tf.float32 and are almost equal.
		```
		
		Args:
		  img1: First image batch.
		  img2: Second image batch.
		  max_val: The dynamic range of the images (i.e., the difference between the
		    maximum the and minimum allowed values).
		
		Returns:
		  A tensor containing an SSIM value for each image in batch.  Returned SSIM
		  values are in range (-1, 1], when pixel values are non-negative. Returns
		  a tensor with shape: broadcast(img1.shape[:-3], img2.shape[:-3]).

		Arguments:
		  img1: First image batch.
		  img2: Second image batch. Must have the same rank as img1.
		  max_val: The dynamic range of the images (i.e., the difference between the
		    maximum the and minimum allowed values).
		  power_factors: Iterable of weights for each of the scales. The number of
		    scales used is the length of the list. Index 0 is the unscaled
		    resolution's weight and each increasing scale corresponds to the image
		    being downsampled by 2.  Defaults to (0.0448, 0.2856, 0.3001, 0.2363,
		    0.1333), which are the values obtained in the original paper.
		
		Returns:
		  A tensor containing an MS-SSIM value for each image in batch.  The values

		Calculate and return the total variation for one or more images.
		
		The total variation is the sum of the absolute differences for neighboring
		pixel-values in the input images. This measures how much noise is in the
		images.
		
		This can be used as a loss-function during optimization so as to suppress
		noise in images. If you have a batch of images, then you should calculate
		the scalar loss-value as the sum:
		`loss = tf.reduce_sum(tf.image.total_variation(images))`

		Raises:
		  ValueError: if images.shape is not a 3-D or 4-D vector.
		
		Returns:
		  The total variation of `images`.
		
		  If `images` was 4-D, return a 1-D float Tensor of shape `[batch]` with the
		  total variation for each image in the batch.
		  If `images` was 3-D, return a scalar float with the total variation for
		  that image.
