		`SaveableObjects` have a name set, which Checkpointable needs to generate

		Restore a training checkpoint.
		
		Restores this `Checkpoint` and any objects it depends on.
		
		When executing eagerly, either assigns values immediately if variables to
		restore have been created already, or defers restoration until the variables
		are created. Dependencies added after this call will be matched if they have
		a corresponding object in the checkpoint (the restore request will queue in
		any checkpointable object waiting for the expected dependency to be added).
		
		When graph building, restoration ops are added to the graph but not run
		immediately.
		
		To ensure that loading is complete and no more assignments will take place,
		use the `assert_consumed()` method of the status object returned by
		`restore`:
		
		```python
		checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint( ... )
		checkpoint.restore(path).assert_consumed()
		```
		
		An exception will be raised if any Python objects in the dependency graph
		were not found in the checkpoint, or if any checkpointed values do not have
		a matching Python object.
		
		When graph building, `assert_consumed()` indicates that all of the restore
		ops that will be created for this checkpoint have been created. They can be
		run via the `run_restore_ops()` method of the status object:
		
		```python
		checkpoint.restore(path).assert_consumed().run_restore_ops()
		```
		
		If the checkpoint has not been consumed completely, then the list of restore
		ops will grow as more objects are added to the dependency graph.
		
		Name-based `tf.train.Saver` checkpoints can be loaded using this
		method. Names are used to match variables. No restore ops are created/run
		until `run_restore_ops()` or `initialize_or_restore()` are called on the
		returned status object when graph building, but there is restore-on-creation
		when executing eagerly. Re-encode name-based checkpoints using
		`tf.train.Checkpoint.save` as soon as possible.
		
		Args:
		  save_path: The path to the checkpoint, as returned by `save` or
		    `tf.train.latest_checkpoint`. If None (as when there is no latest
		    checkpoint for `tf.train.latest_checkpoint` to return), returns an
		    object which may run initializers for objects in the dependency
		    graph. If the checkpoint was written by the name-based `tf.train.Saver`,
		    names are used to match variables.
		
		Returns:
		  A load status object, which can be used to make assertions about the
		  status of a checkpoint restoration and run initialization/restore ops.
		
		  The returned status object has the following methods:
		  - `assert_consumed()`:
		      Raises an exception if any variables/objects are unmatched: either
		      checkpointed values which don't have a matching Python object or
		      Python objects in the dependency graph with no values in the
		      checkpoint. This method returns the status object, and so may be
		      chained with `initialize_or_restore` or `run_restore_ops`.
		  -  `assert_existing_objects_matched()`:
		      Raises an exception if any existing Python objects in the dependency
		      graph are unmatched. Unlike `assert_consumed`, this assertion will
		      pass if values in the checkpoint have no corresponding Python
		      objects. For example a `tf.keras.Layer` object which has not yet been
		      built, and so has not created any variables, will pass this assertion
		      but fail `assert_consumed`. Useful when loading part of a larger
		      checkpoint into a new Python program, e.g. a training checkpoint with
		      a `tf.train.Optimizer` was saved but only the state required for
		      inference is being loaded. This method returns the status object, and
		      so may be chained with `initialize_or_restore` or `run_restore_ops`.
		  - `initialize_or_restore(session=None)`:
		      When graph building, runs variable initializers if `save_path` is
		      `None`, but otherwise runs restore operations. If no `session` is
		      explicitly specified, the default session is used. No effect when
		      executing eagerly (variables are initialized or restored eagerly).
		  - `run_restore_ops(session=None)`:
		      When graph building, runs restore operations. If no `session` is
		      explicitly specified, the default session is used. No effect when
		      executing eagerly (restore operations are run eagerly). May only be
		      called when `save_path` is not `None`.
