		Converts all convolution kernels in a model from Theano to TensorFlow.

		Utility useful when changing a convnet's `data_format`.
		
		When porting the weights of a convnet from one data format to the other,
		if the convnet includes a `Flatten` layer
		(applied to the last convolutional feature map)
		followed by a `Dense` layer, the weights of that `Dense` layer
		should be updated to reflect the new dimension ordering.
		
		Arguments:
		    dense: The target `Dense` layer.
		    previous_feature_map_shape: A shape tuple of 3 integers,
		        e.g. `(512, 7, 7)`. The shape of the convolutional
		        feature map right before the `Flatten` layer that
		        came before the target `Dense` layer.
		    target_data_format: One of "channels_last", "channels_first".
		        Set it "channels_last"
		        if converting a "channels_first" model to "channels_last",
		        or reciprocally.
