		     Defaults to tf.contrib.eager.DEVICE_PLACEMENT_SILENT_FOR_INT32.
		     Valid values:
		     - tfe.DEVICE_PLACEMENT_EXPLICIT: raises an error if the placement is

		     - tfe.DEVICE_PLACEMENT_SILENT_FOR_INT32: silently copies int32 tensors,

		  execution_mode: (Optional.) Policy controlling how operations dispatched
		    are actually executed. When set to None, an appropriate value will be
		    picked automatically. The value picked may change between TensorFlow
		    releases.
		    Valid values:
		    - tf.contrib.eager.SYNC: executes each operation synchronously.
		    - tf.contrib.eager.ASYNC: executes each operation asynchronously. These

		  server_def: (Optional.) A tensorflow::ServerDef proto.
		    Enables execution on remote devices. GrpcServers need to be started by
		    creating an identical server_def to this, and setting the appropriate
		    task_indexes, so that the servers can communicate. It will then be

		Raises:
