		depth
		    Maximum recursion depth (Default -1 for unlimited).
		done
		    Internal. Used to pass information when recursing.
		    Dict of Apply instances that have already been printed and their

		print_type
		    Whether to print the Variable type after the other infos.
		file
		    File-like object to which to print.
		print_destroy_map
		    Whether to print the op destroy_map after other info.
		print_view_map
		    Whether to print the op view_map after other info.
		order
		    If not empty will print the index in the toposort.
		ids
		    How do we print the identifier of the variable :
		    id - print the python id value,
		    int - print integer character,
		    CHAR - print capital character,
		    "" - don't print an identifier.
		stop_on_name
		    When True, if a node in the graph has a name, we don't print anything

		scan_ops
		    Scan ops in the graph will be added inside this list for later printing

		used_ids
		    Internal. Used to pass information when recursing.
		    It is a dict from obj to the id used for it.
		    It wasn't always printed, but at least a reference to it was printed.
		print_clients
		    If True, we will print the clients of nodes when they have more then one clients.

		Re-raise an exception while annotating the exception object with

		Parameters
		----------
		node : Apply node
		    The Apply node object that resulted in the raised exception.
		exc_info : tuple, optional
		    A tuple containing the exception type, exception object and

		storage_map: dict, optional

		Notes
		-----
		This re-raises the exception described by `exc_info` (or the last
		one raised, if `exc_info` is omitted) and annotates the exception
		object with several new members which may be helpful for debugging
		Theano graphs. They are:
		
		 * __op_instance__: The Op that is responsible for the exception
		   being raised.
		 * __thunk_trace__: A traceback corresponding to the code that
		   actually generated the exception, if it is available.
		 * __applynode_index__: The index of the Apply node corresponding
		   to this op in `op.fgraph.toposort()`.
		
		The exception is not annotated if it is of type `KeyboardInterrupt`.
