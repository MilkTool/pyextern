		Generalizes a scalar op to tensors.
		
		All the inputs must have the same number of dimensions. When the

		Parameters
		----------
		scalar_op
		    An instance of a subclass of scalar.ScalarOp which works uniquely

		    A dictionary that maps the index of an output to the
		    index of an input so the output is calculated inplace using

		    Either None or a tuple of three elements,

		    implements this operation, takes nin inputs and nout outputs.
		    Note that nin cannot always be inferred from the scalar op's
		    own nin field because that value is sometimes 0 (meaning a
		    variable number of inputs), whereas the numpy function may

		Parameters
		----------
		x : tensor
		    A Tensor with sizes e.g.: for 3D (dim1, dim3, dim2)
		y : tensor
		    A Tensor with sizes e.g.: for 3D (dim1, dim2, dim4)
		axes: int or array-like of length 2
		    If an integer, the number of axes to sum over.
		    If an array, it must have two array elements containing the axes to sum
		    over in each tensor.
		
		    If an integer i, it is converted to an array containing
		    the last i dimensions of the first tensor and the first
		    i dimensions of the second tensor (excluding the first
		    (batch) dimension):
		        axes = [list(range(a.ndim - i, b.ndim)), list(range(1,i+1))]
		
		    If an array, its two elements must contain compatible axes
		    of the two tensors. For example, [[1, 2], [2, 4]] means sum
		    over the 2nd and 3rd axes of a and the 3rd and 5th axes of b.
		    (Remember axes are zero-indexed!) The 2nd axis of a and the
		    3rd axis of b must have the same shape; the same is true for
		    the 3rd axis of a and the 5th axis of b.

	/**
		Construct an array from an index array and a set of arrays to choose from.
		
		First of all, if confused or uncertain, definitely look at the Examples -
		in its full generality, this function is less simple than it might seem
		from the following code description (below ndi = numpy.lib.index_tricks):
		
		np.choose(a,c) == np.array([c[a[I]][I] for I in ndi.ndindex(a.shape)]).
		
		But this omits some subtleties. Here is a fully general summary:
		
		Given an ``index`` array (a) of integers and a sequence of n arrays
		(choices), a and each choice array are first broadcast, as necessary,
		to arrays of a common shape; calling these Ba and
		Bchoices[i], i = 0,...,n-1 we have that, necessarily,
		Ba.shape == Bchoices[i].shape for each i.
		Then, a new array with shape Ba.shape is created as follows:
		
		- if mode=raise (the default), then, first of all, each element of a
		  (and thus Ba) must be in the range [0, n-1]; now, suppose that
		  i (in that range) is the value at the (j0, j1, ..., jm) position in Ba -
		  then the value at the same position in the new array is the value in
		  Bchoices[i] at that same position;
		
		- if mode=wrap, values in a (and thus Ba) may be any (signed) integer;
		  modular arithmetic is used to map integers outside the range [0, n-1]
		  back into that range; and then the new array is constructed as above;
		
		- if mode=clip, values in a (and thus Ba) may be any (signed) integer;
		  negative integers are mapped to 0; values greater than n-1 are mapped
		  to n-1; and then the new array is constructed as above.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a : int array
		    This array must contain integers in [0, n-1], where n is the number of
		    choices, unless mode=wrap or mode=clip, in which cases any integers
		    are permissible.
		choices : sequence of arrays
		    Choice arrays. a and all of the choices must be broadcastable to
		    the same shape. If choices is itself an array (not recommended),
		    then its outermost dimension (i.e., the one corresponding to
		    choices.shape[0]) is taken as defining the ``sequence``.
		out : array, optional
		    If provided, the result will be inserted into this array.
		    It should be of the appropriate shape and dtype.
		mode : {``raise`` (default), ``wrap``, ``clip``}, optional
		    Specifies how indices outside [0, n-1] will be treated:
		    ``raise`` : an exception is raised
		    ``wrap`` : value becomes value mod n
		    ``clip`` : values < 0 are mapped to 0, values > n-1 are mapped to n-1
		
		Returns
		-------
		merged_array - array
		    The merged result.
		
		Raises
		------
		ValueError - shape mismatch
		    If a and each choice array are not all broadcastable to the same shape.
	**/
	static public function choose(a:Dynamic, choices:Dynamic, ?out:Dynamic, ?mode:Dynamic):Dynamic;
	/**
		Clip x to be between min and max.
		
		Notes
		-----
		When `x` is equal to the boundaries, the output is considered
		to be `x`, so at these points, the gradient of the cost wrt the output
		will be propagated to `x`, not to `min` nor `max`. In other words,
		on these points, the gradient wrt `x` will be equal to the gradient wrt
		the output, and the gradient wrt `min` and `max` will be zero.

		Computes the dot product of two variables.
		
		For two matrices, this is equivalent to matrix multiplication.
		For two vectors, this is the inner product.
		When one variable is a scalar, this is like elementwise multiplication.
		For N dimensions, this is a sum product over the last axis
		of the first array and the second-to-last axis of the second array:
		
		    dot(a, b)[i,j,k,m] = sum(a[i,j,:] * b[k,:,m])
		
		Note that this dot function does one of three things, in the following
		sequence:
		
		    1.  If either a or b is scalar, it returns the elementwise product
		        without calling the Theano Dot op.
		
		    2.  If either a or b has more than 2 dimensions, it calls Theano's
		        tensordot function with appropriate axes. The tensordot function
		        expresses high-dimensional dot products in terms of 2D matrix
		        multiplications, so it may be possible to futherize optimize for

		Generalizes a scalar op to tensors.
		
		All the inputs must have the same number of dimensions. When the
		Op is performed, for each dimension, each input's size for that
		dimension must be the same. As a special case, it can also be 1
		but only if the input's broadcastable flag is True for that
		dimension. In that case, the tensor is (virtually) replicated
		along that dimension to match the size of the others.
		
		The dtypes of the outputs mirror those of the scalar Op that is
		being generalized to tensors. In particular, if the calculations
		for an output are done inplace on an input, the output type must
		be the same as the corresponding input type (see the doc of
		scalar.ScalarOp to get help about controlling the output type)
		
		Parameters
		----------
		scalar_op
		    An instance of a subclass of scalar.ScalarOp which works uniquely
		    on scalars.
		inplace_pattern
		    A dictionary that maps the index of an output to the
		    index of an input so the output is calculated inplace using
		    the input's storage. (Just like destroymap, but without the lists.)
		nfunc_spec
		    Either None or a tuple of three elements,
		    (nfunc_name, nin, nout) such that getattr(numpy, nfunc_name)
		    implements this operation, takes nin inputs and nout outputs.
		    Note that nin cannot always be inferred from the scalar op's
		    own nin field because that value is sometimes 0 (meaning a
		    variable number of inputs), whereas the numpy function may
		    not have varargs.

		Basic design philosophy
		-----------------------
		
		The idea behind this function is that it can be used as parts of
		command line tools for debugging or for error messages. The
		information displayed is intended to be concise and easily read by
		a human. In particular, it is intended to be informative when
		working with large graphs composed of subgraphs from several
		different people's code, as in pylearn2.
		
		Stopping expanding subtrees when named variables are encountered
		makes it easier to understand what is happening when a graph
		formed by composing several different graphs made by code written
		by different authors has a bug.
		
		An example output is:
		
		A. Elemwise{add_no_inplace}
		    B. log_likelihood_v_given_h
		    C. log_likelihood_h
		
		
		If the user is told they have a problem computing this value, it's
		obvious that either log_likelihood_h or log_likelihood_v_given_h
		has the wrong dimensionality. The variable's str object would only
		tell you that there was a problem with an
		Elemwise{add_no_inplace}. Since there are many such ops in a
		typical graph, such an error message is considerably less
		informative. Error messages based on this function should convey
		much more information about the location in the graph of the error
		while remaining succint.
		
		One final note: the use of capital letters to uniquely identify
		nodes within the graph is motivated by legibility. I do not use
		numbers or lower case letters since these are pretty common as
		parts of names of ops, etc. I also don't use the object's id like
		in debugprint because it gives such a long string that takes time
		to visually diff.

	/**
		Compute a generalized dot product over provided axes.
		
		Given two tensors a and b, tensordot computes a generalized dot product over
		the provided axes. Theano's implementation reduces all expressions to
		matrix or vector dot products and is based on code from Tijmen Tieleman's
		gnumpy (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/gnumpy.html).
		
		Parameters
		----------
		a: symbolic tensor
		    The first tensor variable.
		b: symbolic tensor
		    The second tensor variable
		axes: int or array-like of length 2
		    If an integer, the number of axes to sum over.
		    If an array, it must have two array elements containing the axes
		    to sum over in each tensor.
		
		    Note that the default value of 2 is not guaranteed to work
		    for all values of a and b, and an error will be raised if
		    that is the case. The reason for keeping the default is to
		    maintain the same signature as numpy's tensordot function
		    (and np.tensordot raises analogous errors for non-compatible
		    inputs).
		
		    If an integer i, it is converted to an array containing
		    the last i dimensions of the first tensor and the first
		    i dimensions of the second tensor:
		        axes = [list(range(a.ndim - i, b.ndim)), list(range(i))]
		
		    If an array, its two elements must contain compatible axes
		    of the two tensors. For example, [[1, 2], [2, 0]] means sum
		    over the 2nd and 3rd axes of a and the 3rd and 1st axes of b.
		    (Remember axes are zero-indexed!) The 2nd axis of a and the
		    3rd axis of b must have the same shape; the same is true for
		    the 3rd axis of a and the 1st axis of b.
		
		Returns
		-------
		symbolic tensor
		    A tensor with shape equal to the concatenation of a's shape
		    (less any dimensions that were summed over) and b's shape
		    (less any dimensions that were summed over).
		
		Examples
		--------
		It may be helpful to consider an example to see what tensordot does.
		Theano's implementation is identical to NumPy's. Here a has shape (2, 3, 4)
		and b has shape (5, 6, 4, 3). The axes to sum over are [[1, 2], [3, 2]] --
		note that a.shape[1] == b.shape[3] and a.shape[2] == b.shape[2]; these axes
		are compatible. The resulting tensor will have shape (2, 5, 6) -- the
		dimensions that are not being summed:
		
		>>> a = np.random.random((2,3,4))
		>>> b = np.random.random((5,6,4,3))
		
		#tensordot
		>>> c = np.tensordot(a, b, [[1,2],[3,2]])
		
		#loop replicating tensordot
		>>> a0, a1, a2 = a.shape
		>>> b0, b1, _, _ = b.shape
		>>> cloop = np.zeros((a0,b0,b1))
		
		#loop over non-summed indices -- these exist
		#in the tensor product.
		>>> for i in range(a0):
		...     for j in range(b0):
		...         for k in range(b1):
		...             #loop over summed indices -- these don't exist
		...             #in the tensor product.
		...             for l in range(a1):
		...                 for m in range(a2):
		...                     cloop[i,j,k] += a[i,l,m] * b[j,k,m,l]
		
		>>> np.allclose(c, cloop)
		true
		
		This specific implementation avoids a loop by transposing a and b such that
		the summed axes of a are last and the summed axes of b are first. The
		resulting arrays are reshaped to 2 dimensions (or left as vectors, if
		appropriate) and a matrix or vector dot product is taken. The result is
		reshaped back to the required output dimensions.
		
		In an extreme case, no axes may be specified. The resulting tensor
		will have shape equal to the concatenation of the shapes of a and b:
		
		>>> c = np.tensordot(a, b, 0)
		>>> print(a.shape)
		(2,3,4)
		>>> print(b.shape)
		(5,6,4,3)
		>>> print(c.shape)
		(2,3,4,5,6,4,3)

		Parameters
		----------
		indices : Theano or NumPy array
		    An integer array whose elements are indices into the flattened

		Computes the variance along the given axis(es) of a tensor `input`.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		axis: None or int or (list of int) (see `Sum`)
		    Compute the variance along this axis of the tensor.
		    None means all axes (like numpy).
		ddof: Degrees of freedom; 0 would compute the ML estimate, 1 would compute
		    the unbiased estimate.
		keepdims : bool
		    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are
		    left in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
		    the result will broadcast correctly against the original tensor.
		corrected : bool
		    If this is set to True, the 'corrected_two_pass' algorithm is
		    used to compute the variance.
		    Refer : http://www.cs.yale.edu/publications/techreports/tr222.pdf
		
		Notes
		-----
		Default uses the two-pass algorithm (reference below).
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Two-pass_algorithm
		Also supports 'corrected_two_pass' algorithm (using the 'corrected' flag)
		which is numerically more stable. There exist other implementations that

		Test a gradient by Finite Difference Method. Raise error on failure.
		
		Raises an Exception if the difference between the analytic gradient and
		numerical gradient (computed through the Finite Difference Method) of a
		random projection of the fun's output to a scalar exceeds the given
		tolerance.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> verify_grad(theano.tensor.tanh,
		...             (np.asarray([[2, 3, 4], [-1, 3.3, 9.9]]),),
		...             rng=np.random)
		
		Parameters
		----------
		fun : a Python function
		    `fun` takes Theano variables as inputs, and returns a Theano variable.
		    For instance, an Op instance with  a single output.
		pt : list of numpy.ndarrays
		    Input values, points where the gradient is estimated.
		    These arrays must be either float16, float32, or float64 arrays.
		n_tests : int
		    number of times to run the test
		rng : numpy.random.RandomState, optional
		    random number generator used to sample the output random projection `u`,
		    we test gradient of sum(u * fun) at `pt`
		eps : float, optional
		    stepsize used in the Finite Difference Method (Default
		    None is type-dependent).
		    Raising the value of eps can raise or lower the absolute
		    and relative errors of the verification depending on the
		    Op. Raising eps does not lower the verification quality for
		    linear operations. It is better to raise `eps` than raising
		    `abs_tol` or `rel_tol`.
		out_type : string
		    dtype of output, if complex (i.e., 'complex32' or 'complex64')
		abs_tol : float
		    absolute tolerance used as threshold for gradient comparison
		rel_tol : float
		    relative tolerance used as threshold for gradient comparison
		cast_to_output_type : bool
		    if the output is float32 and cast_to_output_type is True, cast
		    the random projection to float32. Otherwise it is float64.
		    float16 is not handled here.
		no_debug_ref : bool
		    Don't use DebugMode for the numerical gradient function.
		
		Note
		----
		This function does not support multiple outputs. In
		tests/test_scan.py there is an experimental verify_grad that
		covers that case as well by using random projections.

		if cond then ift else iff
		
		Generalizes a scalar op to tensors.
		
		All the inputs must have the same number of dimensions. When the
		Op is performed, for each dimension, each input's size for that
		dimension must be the same. As a special case, it can also be 1
		but only if the input's broadcastable flag is True for that

		for an output are done inplace on an input, the output type must

		Parameters
		----------
		scalar_op
		    An instance of a subclass of scalar.ScalarOp which works uniquely
		    on scalars.
		inplace_pattern
		    A dictionary that maps the index of an output to the
		    index of an input so the output is calculated inplace using
		    the input's storage. (Just like destroymap, but without the lists.)
		nfunc_spec
		    Either None or a tuple of three elements,
		    (nfunc_name, nin, nout) such that getattr(numpy, nfunc_name)
		    implements this operation, takes nin inputs and nout outputs.
		    Note that nin cannot always be inferred from the scalar op's
		    own nin field because that value is sometimes 0 (meaning a
		    variable number of inputs), whereas the numpy function may
		    not have varargs.
