	/**
		A :term:`Variable` is a node in an expression graph that represents a
		variable.
		
		The inputs and outputs of every `Apply` (theano.gof.Apply) are `Variable`
		instances. The input and output arguments to create a `function` are also
		`Variable` instances. A `Variable` is like a strongly-typed variable in
		some other languages; each `Variable` contains a reference to a `Type`
		instance that defines the kind of value the `Variable` can take in a
		computation.
		
		A `Variable` is a container for four important attributes:
		
		- :literal:`type` a `Type` instance defining the kind of value this
		  `Variable` can have,
		
		- :literal:`owner` either None (for graph roots) or the `Apply` instance
		  of which `self` is an output,
		
		- :literal:`index` the integer such that :literal:`owner.outputs[index] is
		  this_variable` (ignored if `owner` is None),
		
		- :literal:`name` a string to use in pretty-printing and debugging.
		
		There are a few kinds of Variables to be aware of: A Variable which is the
		output of a symbolic computation has a reference to the Apply instance to
		which it belongs (property: owner) and the position of itself in the owner's
		output list (property: index).
		
		- `Variable` (this base type) is typically the output of a symbolic
		  computation.
		
		- `Constant` (a subclass) which adds a default and un-replaceable
		  :literal:`value`, and requires that owner is None.
		
		- `TensorVariable` subclass of Variable that represents a numpy.ndarray
		   object.
		
		- `TensorSharedVariable` Shared version of TensorVariable.
		
		- `SparseVariable` subclass of Variable that represents
		  a scipy.sparse.{csc,csr}_matrix object.
		
		- `GpuArrayVariable` subclass of Variable that represents our object on
		  the GPU that is a subset of numpy.ndarray.
		
		- `RandomVariable`.
		
		A Variable which is the output of a symbolic computation will have an owner
		not equal to None.
		
		Using the Variables' owner field and the Apply nodes' inputs fields, one can
		navigate a graph from an output all the way to the inputs. The opposite
		direction is not possible until a FunctionGraph has annotated the Variables
		with the clients field, ie, before the compilation process has begun a
		Variable does not know which Apply nodes take it as input.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		type : a Type instance
		    The type governs the kind of data that can be associated with this
		    variable.
		owner : None or Apply instance
		    The Apply instance which computes the value for this variable.
		index : None or int
		    The position of this Variable in owner.outputs.
		name : None or str
		    A string for pretty-printing and debugging.
		
		Examples
		--------
		
		.. code-block:: python
		
		    import theano
		    from theano import tensor
		
		    a = tensor.constant(1.5)        # declare a symbolic constant
		    b = tensor.fscalar()            # declare a symbolic floating-point scalar
		
		    c = a + b                       # create a simple expression
		
		    f = theano.function([b], [c])   # this works because a has a value associated with it already
		
		    assert 4.0 == f(2.5)            # bind 2.5 to an internal copy of b and evaluate an internal c
		
		    theano.function([a], [c])       # compilation error because b (required by c) is undefined
		
		    theano.function([a,b], [c])     # compilation error because a is constant, it can't be an input
		
		    d = tensor.value(1.5)           # create a value similar to the constant 'a'
		    e = d + b
		    theano.function([d,b], [e])     # this works.  d's default value of 1.5 is ignored.
		
		The python variables :literal:`a,b,c` all refer to instances of type
		`Variable`. The `Variable` referred to by `a` is also an instance of
		`Constant`.
		
		`compile.function` uses each `Apply` instance's `inputs` attribute together
		with each Variable's `owner` field to determine which inputs are necessary
		to compute the function's outputs.
