	/**
		Obtain lock access by creating a given temporary directory (whose base will
		be created if needed, but will not be deleted after the lock is removed).
		If access is refused by the same lock owner during more than 'timeout'
		seconds, then the current lock is overridden. If timeout is None, then no
		timeout is performed.
		
		The lock is performed by creating a 'lock' file in 'tmp_dir' that contains
		a unique id identifying the owner of the lock (the process id, followed by
		a random string).
		
		When there is already a lock, the process sleeps for a random amount of
		time between min_wait and max_wait seconds before trying again.
		
		If 'verbosity' is >= 1, then a message will be displayed when we need to
		wait for the lock. If it is set to a value >1, then this message will be
		displayed each time we re-check for the presence of the lock. Otherwise it
		is displayed only when we notice the lock's owner has changed.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		tmp_dir : str
		    Lock directory that will be created when acquiring the lock.
		timeout : int or None
		    Time (in seconds) to wait before replacing an existing lock (default
		    config 'compile.timeout').
		min_wait: int
		    Minimum time (in seconds) to wait before trying again to get the lock
		    (default config 'compile.wait').
		max_wait: int
		    Maximum time (in seconds) to wait before trying again to get the lock
		    (default 2 * min_wait).
		verbosity : int
		    Amount of feedback displayed to screen (default 1).
