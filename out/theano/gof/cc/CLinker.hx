	/**
		Return a complete hashable signature of the module we compiled.
		
		This function must have the property that no two programs that
		compute different things yield the same key.
		
		The key returned by this function is of the form (version, signature)
		The signature has the following form:
		{{{
		    'CLinker.cmodule_key', compilation args, libraries,
		    header_dirs, numpy ABI version, config hash,
		    (op0, input_signature0, output_signature0),
		    (op1, input_signature1, output_signature1),
		    ...
		    (opK, input_signatureK, output_signatureK),
		}}}
		
		Note that config hash now uses sha256, and not md5.
		
		The signature is a tuple, some elements of which are sub-tuples.
		
		The outer tuple has a brief header, containing the compilation options
		passed to the compiler, the libraries to link against, a sha256 hash
		of theano.config (for all config options where "in_c_key" is True).
		It is followed by elements for every node in the topological ordering
		of `self.fgraph`.
		
		Input Signature
		---------------
		
		Each input signature is a tuple with an element for each input
		to the corresponding Apply node. Each element identifies the
		type of the node input, and the nature of that input in the
		graph.
		
		The nature of a typical variable is encoded by integer pairs
		``((a,b),c)``:
		``a`` is the topological position of the input's owner
		      (-1 for graph inputs),
		``b`` is the index of the variable in the owner's output list.
		``c`` is a flag indicating whether the variable is in the
		      no_recycling set.
		
		If a variable is also a graph output, then its position in the
		outputs list is also bundled with this tuple (after the b).
		
		The nature of a Constant instance is defined as its signature,
		together with two integers: the topological position of the
		first Apply using that Constant instance, and the lowest index
		into that Apply's inputs that refers to that Constant.  (These
		two integers are a surrogate for the id() of the Constant.
		The integers are important because merge-able constants have
		the same signature, but require separate containers in C
		code.)  The membership in no_recycling is also included in the
		signature.
		
		Output Signature
		----------------
		
		The outputs of a node are entirely determined by the node's Op
		and the nature of the inputs, but the set of outputs that may
		be re-used by the computation (the elements of
		self.no_recycling) can affect the code that is generated.
		
		The format of each Op's output signature is a (version, no_recycle)
		pair, where version is incremented if codegen() changes how it
		handles the outputs, and no_recycle is simply a list of
		booleans, indicating whether each output is in the
		no_recycling set. Older versions of compiled modules only have the
		no_recycle list.
