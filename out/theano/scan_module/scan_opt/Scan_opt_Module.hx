	/**
		Checks if Theano graphs represent the same computations.
		
		The two lists `xs`, `ys` should have the same number of entries. The
		function checks if for any corresponding pair `(x,y)` from `zip(xs,ys)`
		`x` and `y` represent the same computations on the same variables
		(unless equivalences are provided using `in_xs`, `in_ys`).
		
		If `in_xs` and `in_ys` are provided, then when comparing a node `x` with
		a node `y` they are automatically considered as equal if there is some
		index `i` such that `x == in_xs[i]` and `y == in_ys[i]`(and they both
		have the same type). Note that `x` and `y` can be in the list `xs` and
		`ys`, but also represent subgraphs of a computational graph in `xs`
		or `ys`.

	/**
		Return the constant scalar(0-D) value underlying variable `v`.
		
		If `v` is the output of dimshuffles, fills, allocs, rebroadcasts,
		cast, OutputGuard, DeepCopyOp, ScalarFromTensor, ScalarOp, Elemwise
		and some pattern with Subtensor, this function digs through them.
		
		If `v` is not some view of constant scalar data, then raise a
		NotScalarConstantError.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		elemwise : bool
		    If False, we won't try to go into elemwise. So this call is faster.
		    But we still investigate in Second Elemwise (as this is a substitute
		    for Alloc)
		only_process_constants : bool
		    If True, we only attempt to obtain the value of `orig_v` if it's
		    directly constant and don't try to dig through dimshuffles, fills,
		    allocs, and other to figure out its value.
		max_recur : int
		    The maximum number of recursion.
		
		Notes
		-----
		    There may be another function similar to this one in the code,
		    but I'm not sure where it is.

		Notes
		-----
		This function will ignore nodes that are in an fgraph.
		It is used to pre-merge nodes generated inside an optimization,

		It is useful if there are many such replacements to make,

		This function traverses the computation graph described by all

		fgraph. It applies each of the local_optimizations on the traversed graph.
		
		Its main use is to apply locally constant folding when generating
		the graph of the indices of a subtensor.
		
		We should not apply optimizations on node that are in fgraph.
		So we don't optimize node that have an attribute fgraph.
		
		Notes
		-----
		This doesn't do an equilibrium... So if there is optimization
		like local_upcast_elemwise_constant_inputs in the list, that
		adds additional node to the inputs of the node, it can
		be needed to call this function multiple times.
