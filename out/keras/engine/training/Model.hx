		        See [losses](/losses).
		        If the model has multiple outputs, you can use a different loss

		        The loss value that will be minimized by the model
		        will then be the sum of all individual losses.
		    metrics: List of metrics to be evaluated by the model

		        Typically you will use `metrics=['accuracy']`.
		        To specify different metrics for different outputs of a

		    sample_weight_mode: If you need to do timestep-wise

		        If the model has multiple outputs, you can use a different

		    target_tensors: By default, Keras will create placeholders for the
		        model's target, which will be fed with the target data during
		        training. If instead you would like to use your own
		        target tensors (in turn, Keras will not expect external

		        'batch' is a special option for dealing with the

	/**
		Trains the model on data generated batch-by-batch by a Python generator
		(or an instance of `Sequence`).
		
		The generator is run in parallel to the model, for efficiency.
		For instance, this allows you to do real-time data augmentation
		on images on CPU in parallel to training your model on GPU.
		
		The use of `keras.utils.Sequence` guarantees the ordering
		and guarantees the single use of every input per epoch when
		using `use_multiprocessing=True`.
		
		# Arguments
		    generator: A generator or an instance of `Sequence`
		        (`keras.utils.Sequence`) object in order to avoid
		        duplicate data when using multiprocessing.
		        The output of the generator must be either
		        - a tuple `(inputs, targets)`
		        - a tuple `(inputs, targets, sample_weights)`.
		        This tuple (a single output of the generator) makes a single
		        batch. Therefore, all arrays in this tuple must have the same
		        length (equal to the size of this batch). Different batches may
		        have different sizes. For example, the last batch of the epoch
		        is commonly smaller than the others, if the size of the dataset
		        is not divisible by the batch size.
		        The generator is expected to loop over its data
		        indefinitely. An epoch finishes when `steps_per_epoch`
		        batches have been seen by the model.
		    steps_per_epoch: Integer.
		        Total number of steps (batches of samples)
		        to yield from `generator` before declaring one epoch
		        finished and starting the next epoch. It should typically
		        be equal to the number of samples of your dataset
		        divided by the batch size.
		        Optional for `Sequence`: if unspecified, will use
		        the `len(generator)` as a number of steps.
		    epochs: Integer. Number of epochs to train the model.
		        An epoch is an iteration over the entire data provided,
		        as defined by `steps_per_epoch`.
		        Note that in conjunction with `initial_epoch`,
		        `epochs` is to be understood as "final epoch".
		        The model is not trained for a number of iterations
		        given by `epochs`, but merely until the epoch
		        of index `epochs` is reached.
		    verbose: Integer. 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode.
		        0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = one line per epoch.
		    callbacks: List of `keras.callbacks.Callback` instances.
		        List of callbacks to apply during training.
		        See [callbacks](/callbacks).
		    validation_data: This can be either
		        - a generator or a `Sequence` object for the validation data
		        - tuple `(x_val, y_val)`
		        - tuple `(x_val, y_val, val_sample_weights)`
		        on which to evaluate
		        the loss and any model metrics at the end of each epoch.
		        The model will not be trained on this data.
		    validation_steps: Only relevant if `validation_data`
		        is a generator. Total number of steps (batches of samples)
		        to yield from `validation_data` generator before stopping
		        at the end of every epoch. It should typically
		        be equal to the number of samples of your
		        validation dataset divided by the batch size.
		        Optional for `Sequence`: if unspecified, will use
		        the `len(validation_data)` as a number of steps.
		    class_weight: Optional dictionary mapping class indices (integers)
		        to a weight (float) value, used for weighting the loss function
		        (during training only). This can be useful to tell the model to
		        "pay more attention" to samples
		        from an under-represented class.
		    max_queue_size: Integer. Maximum size for the generator queue.
		        If unspecified, `max_queue_size` will default to 10.
		    workers: Integer. Maximum number of processes to spin up
		        when using process-based threading.
		        If unspecified, `workers` will default to 1. If 0, will
		        execute the generator on the main thread.
		    use_multiprocessing: Boolean.
		        If `True`, use process-based threading.
		        If unspecified, `use_multiprocessing` will default to `False`.
		        Note that because this implementation
		        relies on multiprocessing,
		        you should not pass non-picklable arguments to the generator
		        as they can't be passed easily to children processes.
		    shuffle: Boolean. Whether to shuffle the order of the batches at
		        the beginning of each epoch. Only used with instances
		        of `Sequence` (`keras.utils.Sequence`).
		        Has no effect when `steps_per_epoch` is not `None`.
		    initial_epoch: Integer.
		        Epoch at which to start training
		        (useful for resuming a previous training run).
		
		# Returns
		    A `History` object. Its `History.history` attribute is
		    a record of training loss values and metrics values
		    at successive epochs, as well as validation loss values
		    and validation metrics values (if applicable).
		
		# Raises
		    ValueError: In case the generator yields data in an invalid format.
		
		# Example
		
		```python
		def generate_arrays_from_file(path):
		    while True:
		        with open(path) as f:

		        from this class during training.
		        This can be useful to tell the model to "pay more attention" to
