	/**
		This is Algorithm 2.2.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		A : ndarray or other linear operator
		    A linear operator that can produce matrix products.
		AT : ndarray or other linear operator
		    The transpose of A.
		t : int, optional
		    A positive parameter controlling the tradeoff between
		    accuracy versus time and memory usage.
		
		Returns
		-------
		g : sequence
		    A non-negative decreasing vector
		    such that g[j] is a lower bound for the 1-norm
		    of the column of A of jth largest 1-norm.
		    The first entry of this vector is therefore a lower bound
		    on the 1-norm of the linear operator A.
		    This sequence has length t.
		ind : sequence
		    The ith entry of ind is the index of the column A whose 1-norm
		    is given by g[i].
		    This sequence of indices has length t, and its entries are
		    chosen from range(n), possibly with repetition,
		    where n is the order of the operator A.
		
		Notes
		-----
		This algorithm is mainly for testing.
		It uses the 'ind' array in a way that is similar to
		its usage in algorithm 2.4.  This algorithm 2.2 may be easier to test,
		so it gives a chance of uncovering bugs related to indexing
		which could have propagated less noticeably to algorithm 2.4.

		Compute a lower bound of the 1-norm of a sparse matrix.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		A : ndarray or other linear operator
		    A linear operator that can produce matrix products.
		AT : ndarray or other linear operator
		    The transpose of A.
		t : int, optional
		    A positive parameter controlling the tradeoff between
		    accuracy versus time and memory usage.
		itmax : int, optional
		    Use at most this many iterations.
		
		Returns
		-------
		est : float
		    An underestimate of the 1-norm of the sparse matrix.
		v : ndarray, optional
		    The vector such that ||Av||_1 == est*||v||_1.
		    It can be thought of as an input to the linear operator
		    that gives an output with particularly large norm.
		w : ndarray, optional
		    The vector Av which has relatively large 1-norm.
		    It can be thought of as an output of the linear operator
		    that is relatively large in norm compared to the input.
		nmults : int, optional
		    The number of matrix products that were computed.
		nresamples : int, optional
		    The number of times a parallel column was observed,
		    necessitating a re-randomization of the column.
		
		Notes
		-----
		This is algorithm 2.4.

		Return A as a LinearOperator.
		
		'A' may be any of the following types:

		 - An object with .shape and .matvec attributes

		If 'A' has no .dtype attribute, the data type is determined by calling

		Compute a lower bound of the 1-norm of a sparse matrix.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		A : ndarray or other linear operator
		    A linear operator that can be transposed and that can
		    produce matrix products.
		t : int, optional
		    A positive parameter controlling the tradeoff between
		    accuracy versus time and memory usage.
		    Larger values take longer and use more memory

		itmax : int, optional
		    Use at most this many iterations.
		compute_v : bool, optional
		    Request a norm-maximizing linear operator input vector if True.
		compute_w : bool, optional
		    Request a norm-maximizing linear operator output vector if True.
		
		Returns
		-------
		est : float
		    An underestimate of the 1-norm of the sparse matrix.
		v : ndarray, optional
		    The vector such that ||Av||_1 == est*||v||_1.
		    It can be thought of as an input to the linear operator
		    that gives an output with particularly large norm.
		w : ndarray, optional
		    The vector Av which has relatively large 1-norm.
		    It can be thought of as an output of the linear operator
		    that is relatively large in norm compared to the input.
		
		Notes
		-----
		This is algorithm 2.4 of [1].
		
		In [2] it is described as follows.
		"This algorithm typically requires the evaluation of
		about 4t matrix-vector products and almost invariably
		produces a norm estimate (which is, in fact, a lower
		bound on the norm) correct to within a factor 3."
