	/**
		Finds the global minimum of a multivariate function.
		Differential Evolution is stochastic in nature (does not use gradient
		methods) to find the minimium, and can search large areas of candidate
		space, but often requires larger numbers of function evaluations than
		conventional gradient based techniques.
		
		The algorithm is due to Storn and Price [1]_.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		func : callable
		    The objective function to be minimized.  Must be in the form
		    ``f(x, *args)``, where ``x`` is the argument in the form of a 1-D array
		    and ``args`` is a  tuple of any additional fixed parameters needed to
		    completely specify the function.
		bounds : sequence
		    Bounds for variables.  ``(min, max)`` pairs for each element in ``x``,
		    defining the lower and upper bounds for the optimizing argument of
		    `func`. It is required to have ``len(bounds) == len(x)``.
		    ``len(bounds)`` is used to determine the number of parameters in ``x``.
		args : tuple, optional
		    Any additional fixed parameters needed to
		    completely specify the objective function.
		strategy : str, optional
		    The differential evolution strategy to use. Should be one of:
		
		        - 'best1bin'
		        - 'best1exp'
		        - 'rand1exp'
		        - 'randtobest1exp'
		        - 'currenttobest1exp'
		        - 'best2exp'
		        - 'rand2exp'
		        - 'randtobest1bin'
		        - 'currenttobest1bin'
		        - 'best2bin'
		        - 'rand2bin'
		        - 'rand1bin'
		
		    The default is 'best1bin'.
		maxiter : int, optional
		    The maximum number of generations over which the entire population is
		    evolved. The maximum number of function evaluations (with no polishing)
		    is: ``(maxiter + 1) * popsize * len(x)``
		popsize : int, optional
		    A multiplier for setting the total population size.  The population has
		    ``popsize * len(x)`` individuals (unless the initial population is
		    supplied via the `init` keyword).
		tol : float, optional
		    Relative tolerance for convergence, the solving stops when
		    ``np.std(pop) <= atol + tol * np.abs(np.mean(population_energies))``,
		    where and `atol` and `tol` are the absolute and relative tolerance
		    respectively.
		mutation : float or tuple(float, float), optional
		    The mutation constant. In the literature this is also known as
		    differential weight, being denoted by F.
		    If specified as a float it should be in the range [0, 2].
		    If specified as a tuple ``(min, max)`` dithering is employed. Dithering
		    randomly changes the mutation constant on a generation by generation
		    basis. The mutation constant for that generation is taken from
		    ``U[min, max)``. Dithering can help speed convergence significantly.
		    Increasing the mutation constant increases the search radius, but will
		    slow down convergence.
		recombination : float, optional
		    The recombination constant, should be in the range [0, 1]. In the
		    literature this is also known as the crossover probability, being
		    denoted by CR. Increasing this value allows a larger number of mutants
		    to progress into the next generation, but at the risk of population
		    stability.
		seed : int or `np.random.RandomState`, optional
		    If `seed` is not specified the `np.RandomState` singleton is used.
		    If `seed` is an int, a new `np.random.RandomState` instance is used,
		    seeded with seed.
		    If `seed` is already a `np.random.RandomState instance`, then that
		    `np.random.RandomState` instance is used.
		    Specify `seed` for repeatable minimizations.
		disp : bool, optional
		    Display status messages
		callback : callable, `callback(xk, convergence=val)`, optional
		    A function to follow the progress of the minimization. ``xk`` is
		    the current value of ``x0``. ``val`` represents the fractional
		    value of the population convergence.  When ``val`` is greater than one
		    the function halts. If callback returns `True`, then the minimization
		    is halted (any polishing is still carried out).
		polish : bool, optional
		    If True (default), then `scipy.optimize.minimize` with the `L-BFGS-B`
		    method is used to polish the best population member at the end, which
		    can improve the minimization slightly.
		init : str or array-like, optional
		    Specify which type of population initialization is performed. Should be
		    one of:
		
		        - 'latinhypercube'
		        - 'random'
		        - array specifying the initial population. The array should have
		          shape ``(M, len(x))``, where len(x) is the number of parameters.
		          `init` is clipped to `bounds` before use.
		
		    The default is 'latinhypercube'. Latin Hypercube sampling tries to
		    maximize coverage of the available parameter space. 'random'
		    initializes the population randomly - this has the drawback that
		    clustering can occur, preventing the whole of parameter space being
		    covered. Use of an array to specify a population subset could be used,
		    for example, to create a tight bunch of initial guesses in an location
		    where the solution is known to exist, thereby reducing time for
		    convergence.
		atol : float, optional
		    Absolute tolerance for convergence, the solving stops when
		    ``np.std(pop) <= atol + tol * np.abs(np.mean(population_energies))``,
		    where and `atol` and `tol` are the absolute and relative tolerance
		    respectively.
		
		Returns
		-------
		res : OptimizeResult
		    The optimization result represented as a `OptimizeResult` object.
		    Important attributes are: ``x`` the solution array, ``success`` a
		    Boolean flag indicating if the optimizer exited successfully and
		    ``message`` which describes the cause of the termination. See
		    `OptimizeResult` for a description of other attributes.  If `polish`
		    was employed, and a lower minimum was obtained by the polishing, then
		    OptimizeResult also contains the ``jac`` attribute.
		
		Notes
		-----
		Differential evolution is a stochastic population based method that is
		useful for global optimization problems. At each pass through the population
		the algorithm mutates each candidate solution by mixing with other candidate
		solutions to create a trial candidate. There are several strategies [2]_ for
		creating trial candidates, which suit some problems more than others. The
		'best1bin' strategy is a good starting point for many systems. In this
		strategy two members of the population are randomly chosen. Their difference
		is used to mutate the best member (the `best` in `best1bin`), :math:`b_0`,
		so far:
		
		.. math::
		
		    b' = b_0 + mutation * (population[rand0] - population[rand1])
		
		A trial vector is then constructed. Starting with a randomly chosen 'i'th
		parameter the trial is sequentially filled (in modulo) with parameters from
		`b'` or the original candidate. The choice of whether to use `b'` or the
		original candidate is made with a binomial distribution (the 'bin' in
		'best1bin') - a random number in [0, 1) is generated.  If this number is
		less than the `recombination` constant then the parameter is loaded from
		`b'`, otherwise it is loaded from the original candidate.  The final
		parameter is always loaded from `b'`.  Once the trial candidate is built
		its fitness is assessed. If the trial is better than the original candidate
		then it takes its place. If it is also better than the best overall
		candidate it also replaces that.
		To improve your chances of finding a global minimum use higher `popsize`
		values, with higher `mutation` and (dithering), but lower `recombination`
		values. This has the effect of widening the search radius, but slowing
		convergence.

		Examples
		--------
		Let us consider the problem of minimizing the Rosenbrock function. This
		function is implemented in `rosen` in `scipy.optimize`.
		
		>>> from scipy.optimize import rosen, differential_evolution
		>>> bounds = [(0,2), (0, 2), (0, 2), (0, 2), (0, 2)]
		>>> result = differential_evolution(rosen, bounds)
		>>> result.x, result.fun
		(array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]), 1.9216496320061384e-19)
		
		Next find the minimum of the Ackley function
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization).
		
		>>> from scipy.optimize import differential_evolution
		>>> import numpy as np
		>>> def ackley(x):
		...     arg1 = -0.2 * np.sqrt(0.5 * (x[0] ** 2 + x[1] ** 2))
		...     arg2 = 0.5 * (np.cos(2. * np.pi * x[0]) + np.cos(2. * np.pi * x[1]))
		...     return -20. * np.exp(arg1) - np.exp(arg2) + 20. + np.e
		>>> bounds = [(-5, 5), (-5, 5)]
		>>> result = differential_evolution(ackley, bounds)
		>>> result.x, result.fun
		(array([ 0.,  0.]), 4.4408920985006262e-16)

		        - custom - a callable object (added in version 0.14.0),

		    If not given, chosen to be one of ``BFGS``, ``L-BFGS-B``, ``SLSQP``,
		    depending if the problem has constraints or bounds.
		jac : {callable,  '2-point', '3-point', 'cs', bool}, optional
		    Method for computing the gradient vector. Only for CG, BFGS,
		    Newton-CG, L-BFGS-B, TNC, SLSQP, dogleg, trust-ncg, trust-krylov,
		    trust-exact and trust-constr. If it is a callable, it should be a
		    function that returns the gradient vector:
		
		        ``jac(x, *args) -> array_like, shape (n,)``
		
		    where x is an array with shape (n,) and `args` is a tuple with
		    the fixed parameters. Alternatively, the keywords
		    {'2-point', '3-point', 'cs'} select a finite
		    difference scheme for numerical estimation of the gradient. Options
		    '3-point' and 'cs' are available only to 'trust-constr'.
		    If `jac` is a Boolean and is True, `fun` is assumed to return the
		    gradient along with the objective function. If False, the gradient
		    will be estimated using '2-point' finite difference estimation.
		hess : {callable, '2-point', '3-point', 'cs', HessianUpdateStrategy},  optional
		    Method for computing the Hessian matrix. Only for Newton-CG, dogleg,
		    trust-ncg,  trust-krylov, trust-exact and trust-constr. If it is
		    callable, it should return the  Hessian matrix:
		
		        ``hess(x, *args) -> {LinearOperator, spmatrix, array}, (n, n)``
		
		    where x is a (n,) ndarray and `args` is a tuple with the fixed
		    parameters. LinearOperator and sparse matrix returns are
		    allowed only for 'trust-constr' method. Alternatively, the keywords
		    {'2-point', '3-point', 'cs'} select a finite difference scheme
		    for numerical estimation. Or, objects implementing
		    `HessianUpdateStrategy` interface can be used to approximate
		    the Hessian. Available quasi-Newton methods implementing
		    this interface are:
		
		        - `BFGS`;
		        - `SR1`.
		
		    Whenever the gradient is estimated via finite-differences,
		    the Hessian cannot be estimated with options
		    {'2-point', '3-point', 'cs'} and needs to be
		    estimated using one of the quasi-Newton strategies.
		    Finite-difference options {'2-point', '3-point', 'cs'} and
		    `HessianUpdateStrategy` are available only for 'trust-constr' method.
		hessp : callable, optional
		    Hessian of objective function times an arbitrary vector p. Only for
		    Newton-CG, trust-ncg, trust-krylov, trust-constr.
		    Only one of `hessp` or `hess` needs to be given.  If `hess` is
		    provided, then `hessp` will be ignored.  `hessp` must compute the
		    Hessian times an arbitrary vector:
		
		        ``hessp(x, p, *args) ->  ndarray shape (n,)``
		
		    where x is a (n,) ndarray, p is an arbitrary vector with
		    dimension (n,) and `args` is a tuple with the fixed
		    parameters.
		bounds : sequence or `Bounds`, optional
		    Bounds on variables for L-BFGS-B, TNC, SLSQP and
		    trust-constr methods. There are two ways to specify the bounds:
		
		        1. Instance of `Bounds` class.
		        2. Sequence of ``(min, max)`` pairs for each element in `x`. None
		           is used to specify no bound.
		
		constraints : {Constraint, dict} or List of {Constraint, dict}, optional
		    Constraints definition (only for COBYLA, SLSQP and trust-constr).
		    Constraints for 'trust-constr' are defined as a single object or a
		    list of objects specifying constraints to the optimization problem.
		    Available constraints are:
		
		        - `LinearConstraint`
		        - `NonlinearConstraint`
		
		    Constraints for COBYLA, SLSQP are defined as a list of dictionaries.
		    Each dictionary with fields:
		
		        type : str
		            Constraint type: 'eq' for equality, 'ineq' for inequality.
		        fun : callable
		            The function defining the constraint.
		        jac : callable, optional
		            The Jacobian of `fun` (only for SLSQP).
		        args : sequence, optional
		            Extra arguments to be passed to the function and Jacobian.
		
		    Equality constraint means that the constraint function result is to
		    be zero whereas inequality means that it is to be non-negative.
		    Note that COBYLA only supports inequality constraints.
		tol : float, optional
		    Tolerance for termination. For detailed control, use solver-specific
		    options.
		options : dict, optional
		    A dictionary of solver options. All methods accept the following
		    generic options:
		
		        maxiter : int
		            Maximum number of iterations to perform.
		        disp : bool
		            Set to True to print convergence messages.
		
		    For method-specific options, see :func:`show_options()`.
		callback : callable, optional
		    Called after each iteration. For 'trust-constr' it is a callable with
		    the signature:
		
		        ``callback(xk, OptimizeResult state) -> bool``
		
		    where ``xk`` is the current parameter vector. and ``state``
		    is an `OptimizeResult` object, with the same fields
		    as the ones from the return.  If callback returns True
		    the algorithm execution is terminated.
		    For all the other methods, the signature is:
		
		        ``callback(xk)``
		
		    where ``xk`` is the current parameter vector.
		
		Returns
		-------
		res : OptimizeResult
		    The optimization result represented as a ``OptimizeResult`` object.
		    Important attributes are: ``x`` the solution array, ``success`` a
		    Boolean flag indicating if the optimizer exited successfully and
		    ``message`` which describes the cause of the termination. See
		    `OptimizeResult` for a description of other attributes.

		Notes
		-----
		This section describes the available solvers that can be selected by the
		'method' parameter. The default method is *BFGS*.
		
		**Unconstrained minimization**
		
		Method :ref:`Nelder-Mead <optimize.minimize-neldermead>` uses the
		Simplex algorithm [1]_, [2]_. This algorithm is robust in many
		applications. However, if numerical computation of derivative can be
		trusted, other algorithms using the first and/or second derivatives
		information might be preferred for their better performance in
		general.
		
		Method :ref:`Powell <optimize.minimize-powell>` is a modification
		of Powell's method [3]_, [4]_ which is a conjugate direction
		method. It performs sequential one-dimensional minimizations along
		each vector of the directions set (`direc` field in `options` and
		`info`), which is updated at each iteration of the main
		minimization loop. The function need not be differentiable, and no
		derivatives are taken.
		
		Method :ref:`CG <optimize.minimize-cg>` uses a nonlinear conjugate
		gradient algorithm by Polak and Ribiere, a variant of the
		Fletcher-Reeves method described in [5]_ pp.  120-122. Only the
		first derivatives are used.
		
		Method :ref:`BFGS <optimize.minimize-bfgs>` uses the quasi-Newton
		method of Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno (BFGS) [5]_
		pp. 136. It uses the first derivatives only. BFGS has proven good
		performance even for non-smooth optimizations. This method also
		returns an approximation of the Hessian inverse, stored as
		`hess_inv` in the OptimizeResult object.
		
		Method :ref:`Newton-CG <optimize.minimize-newtoncg>` uses a
		Newton-CG algorithm [5]_ pp. 168 (also known as the truncated
		Newton method). It uses a CG method to the compute the search
		direction. See also *TNC* method for a box-constrained
		minimization with a similar algorithm. Suitable for large-scale
		problems.
		
		Method :ref:`dogleg <optimize.minimize-dogleg>` uses the dog-leg
		trust-region algorithm [5]_ for unconstrained minimization. This
		algorithm requires the gradient and Hessian; furthermore the
		Hessian is required to be positive definite.
		
		Method :ref:`trust-ncg <optimize.minimize-trustncg>` uses the
		Newton conjugate gradient trust-region algorithm [5]_ for
		unconstrained minimization. This algorithm requires the gradient
		and either the Hessian or a function that computes the product of
		the Hessian with a given vector. Suitable for large-scale problems.
		
		Method :ref:`trust-krylov <optimize.minimize-trustkrylov>` uses
		the Newton GLTR trust-region algorithm [14]_, [15]_ for unconstrained
		minimization. This algorithm requires the gradient
		and either the Hessian or a function that computes the product of
		the Hessian with a given vector. Suitable for large-scale problems.
		On indefinite problems it requires usually less iterations than the
		`trust-ncg` method and is recommended for medium and large-scale problems.
		
		Method :ref:`trust-exact <optimize.minimize-trustexact>`
		is a trust-region method for unconstrained minimization in which
		quadratic subproblems are solved almost exactly [13]_. This
		algorithm requires the gradient and the Hessian (which is
		*not* required to be positive definite). It is, in many
		situations, the Newton method to converge in fewer iteraction
		and the most recommended for small and medium-size problems.
		
		**Bound-Constrained minimization**
		
		Method :ref:`L-BFGS-B <optimize.minimize-lbfgsb>` uses the L-BFGS-B
		algorithm [6]_, [7]_ for bound constrained minimization.
		
		Method :ref:`TNC <optimize.minimize-tnc>` uses a truncated Newton
		algorithm [5]_, [8]_ to minimize a function with variables subject
		to bounds. This algorithm uses gradient information; it is also
		called Newton Conjugate-Gradient. It differs from the *Newton-CG*
		method described above as it wraps a C implementation and allows
		each variable to be given upper and lower bounds.
		
		**Constrained Minimization**
		
		Method :ref:`COBYLA <optimize.minimize-cobyla>` uses the
		Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximation (COBYLA) method
		[9]_, [10]_, [11]_. The algorithm is based on linear
		approximations to the objective function and each constraint. The
		method wraps a FORTRAN implementation of the algorithm. The
		constraints functions 'fun' may return either a single number
		or an array or list of numbers.
		
		Method :ref:`SLSQP <optimize.minimize-slsqp>` uses Sequential
		Least SQuares Programming to minimize a function of several
		variables with any combination of bounds, equality and inequality
		constraints. The method wraps the SLSQP Optimization subroutine
		originally implemented by Dieter Kraft [12]_. Note that the
		wrapper handles infinite values in bounds by converting them into
		large floating values.
		
		Method :ref:`trust-constr <optimize.minimize-trustconstr>` is a
		trust-region algorithm for constrained optimization. It swiches
		between two implementations depending on the problem definition.
		It is the most versatile constrained minimization algorithm
		implemented in SciPy and the most appropriate for large-scale problems.
		For equality constrained problems it is an implementation of Byrd-Omojokun
		Trust-Region SQP method described in [17]_ and in [5]_, p. 549. When
		inequality constraints  are imposed as well, it swiches to the trust-region
		interior point  method described in [16]_. This interior point algorithm,
		in turn, solves inequality constraints by introducing slack variables
		and solving a sequence of equality-constrained barrier problems
		for progressively smaller values of the barrier parameter.
		The previously described equality constrained SQP method is
		used to solve the subproblems with increasing levels of accuracy
		as the iterate gets closer to a solution.
		
		**Finite-Difference Options**
		
		For Method :ref:`trust-constr <optimize.minimize-trustconstr>`
		the gradient and the Hessian may be approximated using
		three finite-difference schemes: {'2-point', '3-point', 'cs'}.
		The scheme 'cs' is, potentially, the most accurate but it
		requires the function to correctly handles complex inputs and to
		be differentiable in the complex plane. The scheme '3-point' is more
		accurate than '2-point' but requires twice as much operations.
		
		**Custom minimizers**
		
		It may be useful to pass a custom minimization method, for example
		when using a frontend to this method such as `scipy.optimize.basinhopping`
		or a different library.  You can simply pass a callable as the ``method``
		parameter.
		
		The callable is called as ``method(fun, x0, args, **kwargs, **options)``
		where ``kwargs`` corresponds to any other parameters passed to `minimize`
		(such as `callback`, `hess`, etc.), except the `options` dict, which has
		its contents also passed as `method` parameters pair by pair.  Also, if
		`jac` has been passed as a bool type, `jac` and `fun` are mangled so that
		`fun` returns just the function values and `jac` is converted to a function
		returning the Jacobian.  The method shall return an ``OptimizeResult``
		object.
		
		The provided `method` callable must be able to accept (and possibly ignore)
		arbitrary parameters; the set of parameters accepted by `minimize` may
		expand in future versions and then these parameters will be passed to
		the method.  You can find an example in the scipy.optimize tutorial.

		Examples
		--------
		Let us consider the problem of minimizing the Rosenbrock function. This
		function (and its respective derivatives) is implemented in `rosen`
		(resp. `rosen_der`, `rosen_hess`) in the `scipy.optimize`.
		
		>>> from scipy.optimize import minimize, rosen, rosen_der
		
		A simple application of the *Nelder-Mead* method is:
		
		>>> x0 = [1.3, 0.7, 0.8, 1.9, 1.2]
		>>> res = minimize(rosen, x0, method='Nelder-Mead', tol=1e-6)
		>>> res.x
		array([ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
		
		Now using the *BFGS* algorithm, using the first derivative and a few
		options:
		
		>>> res = minimize(rosen, x0, method='BFGS', jac=rosen_der,
		...                options={'gtol': 1e-6, 'disp': True})
		Optimization terminated successfully.
		         Current function value: 0.000000
		         Iterations: 26
		         Function evaluations: 31
		         Gradient evaluations: 31
		>>> res.x
		array([ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
		>>> print(res.message)
		Optimization terminated successfully.
		>>> res.hess_inv
		array([[ 0.00749589,  0.01255155,  0.02396251,  0.04750988,  0.09495377],  # may vary
		       [ 0.01255155,  0.02510441,  0.04794055,  0.09502834,  0.18996269],
		       [ 0.02396251,  0.04794055,  0.09631614,  0.19092151,  0.38165151],
		       [ 0.04750988,  0.09502834,  0.19092151,  0.38341252,  0.7664427 ],
		       [ 0.09495377,  0.18996269,  0.38165151,  0.7664427,   1.53713523]])
		
		
		Next, consider a minimization problem with several constraints (namely
		Example 16.4 from [5]_). The objective function is:
		
		>>> fun = lambda x: (x[0] - 1)**2 + (x[1] - 2.5)**2
		
		There are three constraints defined as:
		
		>>> cons = ({'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x:  x[0] - 2 * x[1] + 2},
		...         {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: -x[0] - 2 * x[1] + 6},
		...         {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: -x[0] + 2 * x[1] + 2})
		
		And variables must be positive, hence the following bounds:
		
		>>> bnds = ((0, None), (0, None))
		
		The optimization problem is solved using the SLSQP method as:
		
		>>> res = minimize(fun, (2, 0), method='SLSQP', bounds=bnds,
		...                constraints=cons)
		
		It should converge to the theoretical solution (1.4 ,1.7).
