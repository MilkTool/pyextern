	/**
		Iterative solver for least-squares problems.
		
		lsmr solves the system of linear equations ``Ax = b``. If the system
		is inconsistent, it solves the least-squares problem ``min ||b - Ax||_2``.
		A is a rectangular matrix of dimension m-by-n, where all cases are
		allowed: m = n, m > n, or m < n. B is a vector of length m.
		The matrix A may be dense or sparse (usually sparse).
		
		Parameters
		----------
		A : {matrix, sparse matrix, ndarray, LinearOperator}
		    Matrix A in the linear system.
		    Alternatively, ``A`` can be a linear operator which can
		    produce ``Ax`` and ``A^T x`` using, e.g.,
		    ``scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator``.
		b : array_like, shape (m,)
		    Vector b in the linear system.
		damp : float
		    Damping factor for regularized least-squares. `lsmr` solves
		    the regularized least-squares problem::
		
		     min ||(b) - (  A   )x||
		         ||(0)   (damp*I) ||_2
		
		    where damp is a scalar.  If damp is None or 0, the system
		    is solved without regularization.
		atol, btol : float, optional
		    Stopping tolerances. `lsmr` continues iterations until a
		    certain backward error estimate is smaller than some quantity
		    depending on atol and btol.  Let ``r = b - Ax`` be the
		    residual vector for the current approximate solution ``x``.
		    If ``Ax = b`` seems to be consistent, ``lsmr`` terminates
		    when ``norm(r) <= atol * norm(A) * norm(x) + btol * norm(b)``.
		    Otherwise, lsmr terminates when ``norm(A^{T} r) <=
		    atol * norm(A) * norm(r)``.  If both tolerances are 1.0e-6 (say),
		    the final ``norm(r)`` should be accurate to about 6
		    digits. (The final x will usually have fewer correct digits,
		    depending on ``cond(A)`` and the size of LAMBDA.)  If `atol`
		    or `btol` is None, a default value of 1.0e-6 will be used.
		    Ideally, they should be estimates of the relative error in the
		    entries of A and B respectively.  For example, if the entries
		    of `A` have 7 correct digits, set atol = 1e-7. This prevents
		    the algorithm from doing unnecessary work beyond the
		    uncertainty of the input data.
		conlim : float, optional
		    `lsmr` terminates if an estimate of ``cond(A)`` exceeds
		    `conlim`.  For compatible systems ``Ax = b``, conlim could be
		    as large as 1.0e+12 (say).  For least-squares problems,
		    `conlim` should be less than 1.0e+8. If `conlim` is None, the
		    default value is 1e+8.  Maximum precision can be obtained by
		    setting ``atol = btol = conlim = 0``, but the number of
		    iterations may then be excessive.
		maxiter : int, optional
		    `lsmr` terminates if the number of iterations reaches
		    `maxiter`.  The default is ``maxiter = min(m, n)``.  For
		    ill-conditioned systems, a larger value of `maxiter` may be
		    needed.
		show : bool, optional
		    Print iterations logs if ``show=True``.
		x0 : array_like, shape (n,), optional
		    Initial guess of x, if None zeros are used.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.0.0
		Returns
		-------
		x : ndarray of float
		    Least-square solution returned.
		istop : int
		    istop gives the reason for stopping::
		
		      istop   = 0 means x=0 is a solution.  If x0 was given, then x=x0 is a
		                  solution.
		              = 1 means x is an approximate solution to A*x = B,
		                  according to atol and btol.
		              = 2 means x approximately solves the least-squares problem
		                  according to atol.
		              = 3 means COND(A) seems to be greater than CONLIM.
		              = 4 is the same as 1 with atol = btol = eps (machine
		                  precision)
		              = 5 is the same as 2 with atol = eps.
		              = 6 is the same as 3 with CONLIM = 1/eps.
		              = 7 means ITN reached maxiter before the other stopping
		                  conditions were satisfied.
		
		itn : int
		    Number of iterations used.
		normr : float
		    ``norm(b-Ax)``
		normar : float
		    ``norm(A^T (b - Ax))``
		norma : float
		    ``norm(A)``
		conda : float
		    Condition number of A.
		normx : float
		    ``norm(x)``

		Examples
		--------
		>>> from scipy.sparse import csc_matrix
		>>> from scipy.sparse.linalg import lsmr
		>>> A = csc_matrix([[1., 0.], [1., 1.], [0., 1.]], dtype=float)
		
		The first example has the trivial solution `[0, 0]`
		
		>>> b = np.array([0., 0., 0.], dtype=float)
		>>> x, istop, itn, normr = lsmr(A, b)[:4]
		>>> istop
		0
		>>> x
		array([ 0.,  0.])
		
		The stopping code `istop=0` returned indicates that a vector of zeros was
		found as a solution. The returned solution `x` indeed contains `[0., 0.]`.
		The next example has a non-trivial solution:
		
		>>> b = np.array([1., 0., -1.], dtype=float)
		>>> x, istop, itn, normr = lsmr(A, b)[:4]
		>>> istop
		1
		>>> x
		array([ 1., -1.])
		>>> itn
		1
		>>> normr
		4.440892098500627e-16
		
		As indicated by `istop=1`, `lsmr` found a solution obeying the tolerance
		limits. The given solution `[1., -1.]` obviously solves the equation. The
		remaining return values include information about the number of iterations
		(`itn=1`) and the remaining difference of left and right side of the solved
		equation.
		The final example demonstrates the behavior in the case where there is no
		solution for the equation:
		
		>>> b = np.array([1., 0.01, -1.], dtype=float)
		>>> x, istop, itn, normr = lsmr(A, b)[:4]
		>>> istop
		2
		>>> x
		array([ 1.00333333, -0.99666667])
		>>> A.dot(x)-b
		array([ 0.00333333, -0.00333333,  0.00333333])
		>>> normr
		0.005773502691896255
		
		`istop` indicates that the system is inconsistent and thus `x` is rather an
		approximate solution to the corresponding least-squares problem. `normr`
		contains the minimal distance that was found.

	/**
		Solve a linear least-squares problem with bounds on the variables.
		
		Given a m-by-n design matrix A and a target vector b with m elements,
		`lsq_linear` solves the following optimization problem::
		
		    minimize 0.5 * ||A x - b||**2
		    subject to lb <= x <= ub
		
		This optimization problem is convex, hence a found minimum (if iterations
		have converged) is guaranteed to be global.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		A : array_like, sparse matrix of LinearOperator, shape (m, n)
		    Design matrix. Can be `scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator`.
		b : array_like, shape (m,)
		    Target vector.
		bounds : 2-tuple of array_like, optional
		    Lower and upper bounds on independent variables. Defaults to no bounds.
		    Each array must have shape (n,) or be a scalar, in the latter
		    case a bound will be the same for all variables. Use ``np.inf`` with
		    an appropriate sign to disable bounds on all or some variables.
		method : 'trf' or 'bvls', optional
		    Method to perform minimization.
		
		        * 'trf' : Trust Region Reflective algorithm adapted for a linear
		          least-squares problem. This is an interior-point-like method
		          and the required number of iterations is weakly correlated with
		          the number of variables.
		        * 'bvls' : Bounded-Variable Least-Squares algorithm. This is
		          an active set method, which requires the number of iterations
		          comparable to the number of variables. Can't be used when `A` is
		          sparse or LinearOperator.
		
		    Default is 'trf'.
		tol : float, optional
		    Tolerance parameter. The algorithm terminates if a relative change
		    of the cost function is less than `tol` on the last iteration.
		    Additionally the first-order optimality measure is considered:
		
		        * ``method='trf'`` terminates if the uniform norm of the gradient,
		          scaled to account for the presence of the bounds, is less than
		          `tol`.
		        * ``method='bvls'`` terminates if Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions
		          are satisfied within `tol` tolerance.
		
		lsq_solver : {None, 'exact', 'lsmr'}, optional
		    Method of solving unbounded least-squares problems throughout
		    iterations:
		
		        * 'exact' : Use dense QR or SVD decomposition approach. Can't be
		          used when `A` is sparse or LinearOperator.
		        * 'lsmr' : Use `scipy.sparse.linalg.lsmr` iterative procedure
		          which requires only matrix-vector product evaluations. Can't
		          be used with ``method='bvls'``.
		
		    If None (default) the solver is chosen based on type of `A`.
		lsmr_tol : None, float or 'auto', optional
		    Tolerance parameters 'atol' and 'btol' for `scipy.sparse.linalg.lsmr`
		    If None (default), it is set to ``1e-2 * tol``. If 'auto', the
		    tolerance will be adjusted based on the optimality of the current
		    iterate, which can speed up the optimization process, but is not always
		    reliable.
		max_iter : None or int, optional
		    Maximum number of iterations before termination. If None (default), it
		    is set to 100 for ``method='trf'`` or to the number of variables for
		    ``method='bvls'`` (not counting iterations for 'bvls' initialization).
		verbose : {0, 1, 2}, optional
		    Level of algorithm's verbosity:
		
		        * 0 : work silently (default).
		        * 1 : display a termination report.
		        * 2 : display progress during iterations.
		
		Returns
		-------
		OptimizeResult with the following fields defined:
		x : ndarray, shape (n,)
		    Solution found.
		cost : float
		    Value of the cost function at the solution.
		fun : ndarray, shape (m,)
		    Vector of residuals at the solution.
		optimality : float
		    First-order optimality measure. The exact meaning depends on `method`,
		    refer to the description of `tol` parameter.
		active_mask : ndarray of int, shape (n,)
		    Each component shows whether a corresponding constraint is active
		    (that is, whether a variable is at the bound):
		
		        *  0 : a constraint is not active.
		        * -1 : a lower bound is active.
		        *  1 : an upper bound is active.
		
		    Might be somewhat arbitrary for the `trf` method as it generates a
		    sequence of strictly feasible iterates and active_mask is determined
		    within a tolerance threshold.
		nit : int
		    Number of iterations. Zero if the unconstrained solution is optimal.
		status : int
		    Reason for algorithm termination:
		
		        * -1 : the algorithm was not able to make progress on the last
		          iteration.
		        *  0 : the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.
		        *  1 : the first-order optimality measure is less than `tol`.
		        *  2 : the relative change of the cost function is less than `tol`.
		        *  3 : the unconstrained solution is optimal.
		
		message : str
		    Verbal description of the termination reason.
		success : bool
		    True if one of the convergence criteria is satisfied (`status` > 0).
		
		See Also
		--------
		nnls : Linear least squares with non-negativity constraint.
		least_squares : Nonlinear least squares with bounds on the variables.                    
		
		Notes
		-----
		The algorithm first computes the unconstrained least-squares solution by
		`numpy.linalg.lstsq` or `scipy.sparse.linalg.lsmr` depending on
		`lsq_solver`. This solution is returned as optimal if it lies within the
		bounds.
		
		Method 'trf' runs the adaptation of the algorithm described in [STIR]_ for
		a linear least-squares problem. The iterations are essentially the same as
		in the nonlinear least-squares algorithm, but as the quadratic function
		model is always accurate, we don't need to track or modify the radius of
		a trust region. The line search (backtracking) is used as a safety net
		when a selected step does not decrease the cost function. Read more
		detailed description of the algorithm in `scipy.optimize.least_squares`.
		
		Method 'bvls' runs a Python implementation of the algorithm described in
		[BVLS]_. The algorithm maintains active and free sets of variables, on
		each iteration chooses a new variable to move from the active set to the
		free set and then solves the unconstrained least-squares problem on free
		variables. This algorithm is guaranteed to give an accurate solution
		eventually, but may require up to n iterations for a problem with n
		variables. Additionally, an ad-hoc initialization procedure is
		implemented, that determines which variables to set free or active
		initially. It takes some number of iterations before actual BVLS starts,
		but can significantly reduce the number of further iterations.

		Matrix or vector norm.
		
		This function is able to return one of eight different matrix norms,
		or one of an infinite number of vector norms (described below), depending
		on the value of the ``ord`` parameter.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    Input array.  If `axis` is None, `x` must be 1-D or 2-D.
		ord : {non-zero int, inf, -inf, 'fro', 'nuc'}, optional

		axis : {int, 2-tuple of ints, None}, optional
		    If `axis` is an integer, it specifies the axis of `x` along which to
		    compute the vector norms.  If `axis` is a 2-tuple, it specifies the
		    axes that hold 2-D matrices, and the matrix norms of these matrices
		    are computed.  If `axis` is None then either a vector norm (when `x`
		    is 1-D) or a matrix norm (when `x` is 2-D) is returned.

		keepdims : bool, optional
		    If this is set to True, the axes which are normed over are left in the

		    Norm of the matrix or vector(s).
		
		Notes
		-----
		For values of ``ord <= 0``, the result is, strictly speaking, not a

		The Frobenius norm is given by [1]_:
		
		    :math:`||A||_F = [\sum_{i,j} abs(a_{i,j})^2]^{1/2}`
		
		The nuclear norm is the sum of the singular values.
