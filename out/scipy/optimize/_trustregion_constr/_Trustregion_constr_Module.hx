	/**
		Minimize a scalar function subject to constraints.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		gtol : float, optional
		    Tolerance for termination by the norm of the Lagrangian gradient.
		    The algorithm will terminate when both the infinity norm (i.e. max
		    abs value) of the Lagrangian gradient and the constraint violation
		    are smaller than ``gtol``. Default is 1e-8.
		xtol : float, optional
		    Tolerance for termination by the change of the independent variable.
		    The algorithm will terminate when ``tr_radius < xtol``, where
		    ``tr_radius`` is the radius of the trust region used in the algorithm.
		    Default is 1e-8.
		barrier_tol : float, optional
		    Threshold on the barrier parameter for the algorithm termination.
		    When inequality constraints are present the algorithm will terminate
		    only when the barrier parameter is less than `barrier_tol`.
		    Default is 1e-8.
		sparse_jacobian : {bool, None}, optional
		    Determines how to represent Jacobians of the constraints. If bool,
		    then Jacobians of all the constraints will be converted to the
		    corresponding format. If None (default), then Jacobians won't be
		    converted, but the algorithm can proceed only if they all have the
		    same format.
		initial_tr_radius: float, optional
		    Initial trust radius. The trust radius gives the maximum distance
		    between solution points in consecutive iterations. It reflects the
		    trust the algorithm puts in the local approximation of the optimization
		    problem. For an accurate local approximation the trust-region should be
		    large and for an  approximation valid only close to the current point it
		    should be a small one. The trust radius is automatically updated throughout
		    the optimization process, with ``initial_tr_radius`` being its initial value.
		    Default is 1 (recommended in [1]_, p. 19).
		initial_constr_penalty : float, optional
		    Initial constraints penalty parameter. The penalty parameter is used for
		    balancing the requirements of decreasing the objective function
		    and satisfying the constraints. It is used for defining the merit function:
		    ``merit_function(x) = fun(x) + constr_penalty * constr_norm_l2(x)``,
		    where ``constr_norm_l2(x)`` is the l2 norm of a vector containing all
		    the constraints. The merit function is used for accepting or rejecting
		    trial points and ``constr_penalty`` weights the two conflicting goals
		    of reducing objective function and constraints. The penalty is automatically
		    updated throughout the optimization  process, with
		    ``initial_constr_penalty`` being its  initial value. Default is 1
		    (recommended in [1]_, p 19).
		initial_barrier_parameter, initial_barrier_tolerance: float, optional
		    Initial barrier parameter and initial tolerance for the barrier subproblem.
		    Both are used only when inequality constraints are present. For dealing with
		    optimization problems ``min_x f(x)`` subject to inequality constraints
		    ``c(x) <= 0`` the algorithm introduces slack variables, solving the problem
		    ``min_(x,s) f(x) + barrier_parameter*sum(ln(s))`` subject to the equality
		    constraints  ``c(x) + s = 0`` instead of the original problem. This subproblem
		    is solved for increasing values of ``barrier_parameter`` and with decreasing
		    tolerances for the termination, starting with ``initial_barrier_parameter``
		    for the barrier parameter and ``initial_barrier_tolerance`` for the
		    barrier subproblem  barrier. Default is 0.1 for both values (recommended in [1]_ p. 19).
		factorization_method : string or None, optional
		    Method to factorize the Jacobian of the constraints. Use None (default)
		    for the auto selection or one of:
		
		        - 'NormalEquation' (requires scikit-sparse)
		        - 'AugmentedSystem'
		        - 'QRFactorization'
		        - 'SVDFactorization'
		
		    The methods 'NormalEquation' and 'AugmentedSystem' can be used only
		    with sparse constraints. The projections required by the algorithm
		    will be computed using, respectively, the the normal equation  and the
		    augmented system approaches explained in [1]_. 'NormalEquation'
		    computes the Cholesky factorization of ``A A.T`` and 'AugmentedSystem'
		    performs the LU factorization of an augmented system. They usually
		    provide similar results. 'AugmentedSystem' is used by default for
		    sparse matrices.
		
		    The methods 'QRFactorization' and 'SVDFactorization' can be used
		    only with dense constraints. They compute the required projections
		    using, respectively, QR and SVD factorizations. The 'SVDFactorization'
		    method can cope with Jacobian matrices with deficient row rank and will
		    be used whenever other factorization methods fail (which may imply the
		    conversion of sparse matrices to a dense format when required).
		    By default 'QRFactorization' is used for dense matrices.
		finite_diff_rel_step : None or array_like, optional
		    Relative step size for the finite difference approximation.
		maxiter : int, optional
		    Maximum number of algorithm iterations. Default is 1000.
		verbose : {0, 1, 2}, optional
		    Level of algorithm's verbosity:
		
		        * 0 (default) : work silently.
		        * 1 : display a termination report.
		        * 2 : display progress during iterations.
		        * 3 : display progress during iterations (more complete report).
		
		disp : bool, optional
		    If True (default) then `verbose` will be set to 1 if it was 0.
		
		Returns
		-------
		`OptimizeResult` with the fields documented below. Note the following:
		
		    1. All values corresponding to the constraints are ordered as they
		       were passed to the solver. And values corresponding to `bounds`
		       constraints are put *after* other constraints.
		    2. All numbers of function, Jacobian or Hessian evaluations correspond
		       to numbers of actual Python function calls. It means, for example,
		       that if a Jacobian is estimated by finite differences then the
		       number of Jacobian evaluations will be zero and the number of
		       function evaluations will be incremented by all calls during the
		       finite difference estimation.
