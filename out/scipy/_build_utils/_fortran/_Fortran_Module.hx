	/**
		Split each file in `source_dir` into separate files per subroutine.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		source_dir : str
		    Full path to directory in which sources to be split are located.
		subroutines : list of str, optional
		    Subroutines to split. (Default: all)
		
		Returns
		-------
		fnames : list of str
		    List of file names (not including any path) that were created
		    in `source_dir`.
		
		Notes
		-----
		This function is useful for code that can't be compiled with g77 because of
		type casting errors which do work with gfortran.
		
		Created files are named: ``original_name + '_subr_i' + '.f'``, with ``i``
		starting at zero and ending at ``num_subroutines_in_file - 1``.
