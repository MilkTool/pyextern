	/**
		Evaluate collocation residuals.
		
		This function lies in the core of the method. The solution is sought
		as a cubic C1 continuous spline with derivatives matching the ODE rhs
		at given nodes `x`. Collocation conditions are formed from the equality
		of the spline derivatives and rhs of the ODE system in the middle points
		between nodes.
		
		Such method is classified to Lobbato IIIA family in ODE literature.
		Refer to [1]_ for the formula and some discussion.
		
		Returns
		-------
		col_res : ndarray, shape (n, m - 1)
		    Collocation residuals at the middle points of the mesh intervals.
		y_middle : ndarray, shape (n, m - 1)
		    Values of the cubic spline evaluated at the middle points of the mesh
		    intervals.
		f : ndarray, shape (n, m)
		    RHS of the ODE system evaluated at the mesh nodes.
		f_middle : ndarray, shape (n, m - 1)
		    RHS of the ODE system evaluated at the middle points of the mesh
		    intervals (and using `y_middle`).

		Matrix or vector norm.
		
		This function is able to return one of eight different matrix norms,
		or one of an infinite number of vector norms (described below), depending
		on the value of the ``ord`` parameter.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like
		    Input array.  If `axis` is None, `x` must be 1-D or 2-D.
		ord : {non-zero int, inf, -inf, 'fro', 'nuc'}, optional
		    Order of the norm (see table under ``Notes``). inf means numpy's
		    `inf` object.
		axis : {int, 2-tuple of ints, None}, optional
		    If `axis` is an integer, it specifies the axis of `x` along which to
		    compute the vector norms.  If `axis` is a 2-tuple, it specifies the
		    axes that hold 2-D matrices, and the matrix norms of these matrices
		    are computed.  If `axis` is None then either a vector norm (when `x`
		    is 1-D) or a matrix norm (when `x` is 2-D) is returned.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
		
		keepdims : bool, optional
		    If this is set to True, the axes which are normed over are left in the
		    result as dimensions with size one.  With this option the result will
		    broadcast correctly against the original `x`.
		
		    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0
		
		Returns
		-------
		n : float or ndarray
		    Norm of the matrix or vector(s).
		
		Notes
		-----
		For values of ``ord <= 0``, the result is, strictly speaking, not a
		mathematical 'norm', but it may still be useful for various numerical
		purposes.
		
		The following norms can be calculated:
		
		=====  ============================  ==========================
		ord    norm for matrices             norm for vectors
		=====  ============================  ==========================
		None   Frobenius norm                2-norm
		'fro'  Frobenius norm                --
		'nuc'  nuclear norm                  --
		inf    max(sum(abs(x), axis=1))      max(abs(x))
		-inf   min(sum(abs(x), axis=1))      min(abs(x))
		0      --                            sum(x != 0)
		1      max(sum(abs(x), axis=0))      as below
		-1     min(sum(abs(x), axis=0))      as below
		2      2-norm (largest sing. value)  as below
		-2     smallest singular value       as below
		other  --                            sum(abs(x)**ord)**(1./ord)
		=====  ============================  ==========================
		
		The Frobenius norm is given by [1]_:
		
		    :math:`||A||_F = [\sum_{i,j} abs(a_{i,j})^2]^{1/2}`
		
		The nuclear norm is the sum of the singular values.

		Solve a boundary-value problem for a system of ODEs.
		
		This function numerically solves a first order system of ODEs subject to
		two-point boundary conditions::
		
		    dy / dx = f(x, y, p) + S * y / (x - a), a <= x <= b
		    bc(y(a), y(b), p) = 0
		
		Here x is a 1-dimensional independent variable, y(x) is a n-dimensional
		vector-valued function and p is a k-dimensional vector of unknown
		parameters which is to be found along with y(x). For the problem to be
		determined there must be n + k boundary conditions, i.e. bc must be
		(n + k)-dimensional function.
		
		The last singular term in the right-hand side of the system is optional.
		It is defined by an n-by-n matrix S, such that the solution must satisfy
		S y(a) = 0. This condition will be forced during iterations, so it must not
		contradict boundary conditions. See [2]_ for the explanation how this term
		is handled when solving BVPs numerically.
		
		Problems in a complex domain can be solved as well. In this case y and p
		are considered to be complex, and f and bc are assumed to be complex-valued
		functions, but x stays real. Note that f and bc must be complex
		differentiable (satisfy Cauchy-Riemann equations [4]_), otherwise you
		should rewrite your problem for real and imaginary parts separately. To
		solve a problem in a complex domain, pass an initial guess for y with a
		complex data type (see below).
		
		Parameters
		----------
		fun : callable
		    Right-hand side of the system. The calling signature is ``fun(x, y)``,
		    or ``fun(x, y, p)`` if parameters are present. All arguments are
		    ndarray: ``x`` with shape (m,), ``y`` with shape (n, m), meaning that
		    ``y[:, i]`` corresponds to ``x[i]``, and ``p`` with shape (k,). The
		    return value must be an array with shape (n, m) and with the same
		    layout as ``y``.
		bc : callable
		    Function evaluating residuals of the boundary conditions. The calling
		    signature is ``bc(ya, yb)``, or ``bc(ya, yb, p)`` if parameters are
		    present. All arguments are ndarray: ``ya`` and ``yb`` with shape (n,),
		    and ``p`` with shape (k,). The return value must be an array with
		    shape (n + k,).
		x : array_like, shape (m,)
		    Initial mesh. Must be a strictly increasing sequence of real numbers
		    with ``x[0]=a`` and ``x[-1]=b``.
		y : array_like, shape (n, m)
		    Initial guess for the function values at the mesh nodes, i-th column
		    corresponds to ``x[i]``. For problems in a complex domain pass `y`
		    with a complex data type (even if the initial guess is purely real).
		p : array_like with shape (k,) or None, optional
		    Initial guess for the unknown parameters. If None (default), it is
		    assumed that the problem doesn't depend on any parameters.
		S : array_like with shape (n, n) or None
		    Matrix defining the singular term. If None (default), the problem is
		    solved without the singular term.
		fun_jac : callable or None, optional
		    Function computing derivatives of f with respect to y and p. The
		    calling signature is ``fun_jac(x, y)``, or ``fun_jac(x, y, p)`` if
		    parameters are present. The return must contain 1 or 2 elements in the
		    following order:
		
		        * df_dy : array_like with shape (n, n, m) where an element
		          (i, j, q) equals to d f_i(x_q, y_q, p) / d (y_q)_j.
		        * df_dp : array_like with shape (n, k, m) where an element
		          (i, j, q) equals to d f_i(x_q, y_q, p) / d p_j.
		
		    Here q numbers nodes at which x and y are defined, whereas i and j
		    number vector components. If the problem is solved without unknown
		    parameters df_dp should not be returned.
		
		    If `fun_jac` is None (default), the derivatives will be estimated
		    by the forward finite differences.
		bc_jac : callable or None, optional
		    Function computing derivatives of bc with respect to ya, yb and p.
		    The calling signature is ``bc_jac(ya, yb)``, or ``bc_jac(ya, yb, p)``
		    if parameters are present. The return must contain 2 or 3 elements in
		    the following order:
		
		        * dbc_dya : array_like with shape (n, n) where an element (i, j)
		          equals to d bc_i(ya, yb, p) / d ya_j.
		        * dbc_dyb : array_like with shape (n, n) where an element (i, j)
		          equals to d bc_i(ya, yb, p) / d yb_j.
		        * dbc_dp : array_like with shape (n, k) where an element (i, j)
		          equals to d bc_i(ya, yb, p) / d p_j.
		
		    If the problem is solved without unknown parameters dbc_dp should not
		    be returned.
		
		    If `bc_jac` is None (default), the derivatives will be estimated by
		    the forward finite differences.
		tol : float, optional
		    Desired tolerance of the solution. If we define ``r = y' - f(x, y)``
		    where y is the found solution, then the solver tries to achieve on each
		    mesh interval ``norm(r / (1 + abs(f)) < tol``, where ``norm`` is
		    estimated in a root mean squared sense (using a numerical quadrature
		    formula). Default is 1e-3.
		max_nodes : int, optional
		    Maximum allowed number of the mesh nodes. If exceeded, the algorithm
		    terminates. Default is 1000.
		verbose : {0, 1, 2}, optional
		    Level of algorithm's verbosity:
		
		        * 0 (default) : work silently.
		        * 1 : display a termination report.
		        * 2 : display progress during iterations.
		
		Returns
		-------

		Notes
		-----
		This function implements a 4-th order collocation algorithm with the
		control of residuals similar to [1]_. A collocation system is solved
		by a damped Newton method with an affine-invariant criterion function as
		described in [3]_.
		
		Note that in [1]_  integral residuals are defined without normalization
		by interval lengths. So their definition is different by a multiplier of
		h**0.5 (h is an interval length) from the definition used here.

		Examples
		--------
		In the first example we solve Bratu's problem::
		
		    y'' + k * exp(y) = 0
		    y(0) = y(1) = 0
		
		for k = 1.
		
		We rewrite the equation as a first order system and implement its
		right-hand side evaluation::
		
		    y1' = y2
		    y2' = -exp(y1)
		
		>>> def fun(x, y):
		...     return np.vstack((y[1], -np.exp(y[0])))
		
		Implement evaluation of the boundary condition residuals:
		
		>>> def bc(ya, yb):
		...     return np.array([ya[0], yb[0]])
		
		Define the initial mesh with 5 nodes:
		
		>>> x = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)
		
		This problem is known to have two solutions. To obtain both of them we
		use two different initial guesses for y. We denote them by subscripts
		a and b.
		
		>>> y_a = np.zeros((2, x.size))
		>>> y_b = np.zeros((2, x.size))
		>>> y_b[0] = 3
		
		Now we are ready to run the solver.
		
		>>> from scipy.integrate import solve_bvp
		>>> res_a = solve_bvp(fun, bc, x, y_a)
		>>> res_b = solve_bvp(fun, bc, x, y_b)
		
		Let's plot the two found solutions. We take an advantage of having the
		solution in a spline form to produce a smooth plot.
		
		>>> x_plot = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
		>>> y_plot_a = res_a.sol(x_plot)[0]
		>>> y_plot_b = res_b.sol(x_plot)[0]
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		>>> plt.plot(x_plot, y_plot_a, label='y_a')
		>>> plt.plot(x_plot, y_plot_b, label='y_b')
		>>> plt.legend()
		>>> plt.xlabel("x")
		>>> plt.ylabel("y")
		>>> plt.show()
		
		We see that the two solutions have similar shape, but differ in scale
		significantly.
		
		In the second example we solve a simple Sturm-Liouville problem::
		
		    y'' + k**2 * y = 0
		    y(0) = y(1) = 0
		
		It is known that a non-trivial solution y = A * sin(k * x) is possible for
		k = pi * n, where n is an integer. To establish the normalization constant
		A = 1 we add a boundary condition::
		
		    y'(0) = k
		
		Again we rewrite our equation as a first order system and implement its
		right-hand side evaluation::
		
		    y1' = y2
		    y2' = -k**2 * y1
		
		>>> def fun(x, y, p):
		...     k = p[0]
		...     return np.vstack((y[1], -k**2 * y[0]))
		
		Note that parameters p are passed as a vector (with one element in our
		case).
		
		Implement the boundary conditions:
		
		>>> def bc(ya, yb, p):
		...     k = p[0]
		...     return np.array([ya[0], yb[0], ya[1] - k])
		
		Setup the initial mesh and guess for y. We aim to find the solution for
		k = 2 * pi, to achieve that we set values of y to approximately follow
		sin(2 * pi * x):
		
		>>> x = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)
		>>> y = np.zeros((2, x.size))
		>>> y[0, 1] = 1
		>>> y[0, 3] = -1
		
		Run the solver with 6 as an initial guess for k.
		
		>>> sol = solve_bvp(fun, bc, x, y, p=[6])
		
		We see that the found k is approximately correct:
		
		>>> sol.p[0]
		6.28329460046
		
		And finally plot the solution to see the anticipated sinusoid:
		
		>>> x_plot = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
		>>> y_plot = sol.sol(x_plot)[0]
		>>> plt.plot(x_plot, y_plot)
		>>> plt.xlabel("x")
		>>> plt.ylabel("y")
		>>> plt.show()

	/**
		Solve the nonlinear collocation system by a Newton method.
		
		This is a simple Newton method with a backtracking line search. As
		advised in [1]_, an affine-invariant criterion function F = ||J^-1 r||^2
		is used, where J is the Jacobian matrix at the current iteration and r is
		the vector or collocation residuals (values of the system lhs).
		
		The method alters between full Newton iterations and the fixed-Jacobian
		iterations based
		
		There are other tricks proposed in [1]_, but they are not used as they
		don't seem to improve anything significantly, and even break the
		convergence on some test problems I tried.
		
		All important parameters of the algorithm are defined inside the function.
