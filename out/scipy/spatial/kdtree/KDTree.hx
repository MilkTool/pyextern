		Count how many nearby pairs can be formed.
		
		Count the number of pairs (x1,x2) can be formed, with x1 drawn

		``distance(x1, x2, p) <= r``.
		This is the "two-point correlation" described in Gray and Moore 2000,
		"N-body problems in statistical learning", and the code here is based
		on their algorithm.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		other : KDTree instance
		    The other tree to draw points from.
		r : float or one-dimensional array of floats
		    The radius to produce a count for. Multiple radii are searched with
		    a single tree traversal.
		p : float, 1<=p<=infinity, optional
		    Which Minkowski p-norm to use
		
		Returns
		-------
		result : int or 1-D array of ints
		    The number of pairs. Note that this is internally stored in a numpy
		    int, and so may overflow if very large (2e9).

	/**
		Query the kd-tree for nearest neighbors
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like, last dimension self.m
		    An array of points to query.
		k : int, optional
		    The number of nearest neighbors to return.
		eps : nonnegative float, optional
		    Return approximate nearest neighbors; the kth returned value
		    is guaranteed to be no further than (1+eps) times the
		    distance to the real kth nearest neighbor.
		p : float, 1<=p<=infinity, optional
		    Which Minkowski p-norm to use.
		    1 is the sum-of-absolute-values "Manhattan" distance
		    2 is the usual Euclidean distance
		    infinity is the maximum-coordinate-difference distance
		distance_upper_bound : nonnegative float, optional
		    Return only neighbors within this distance. This is used to prune
		    tree searches, so if you are doing a series of nearest-neighbor
		    queries, it may help to supply the distance to the nearest neighbor
		    of the most recent point.
		
		Returns
		-------
		d : float or array of floats
		    The distances to the nearest neighbors.
		    If x has shape tuple+(self.m,), then d has shape tuple if
		    k is one, or tuple+(k,) if k is larger than one. Missing
		    neighbors (e.g. when k > n or distance_upper_bound is
		    given) are indicated with infinite distances.  If k is None,
		    then d is an object array of shape tuple, containing lists
		    of distances. In either case the hits are sorted by distance
		    (nearest first).
		i : integer or array of integers
		    The locations of the neighbors in self.data. i is the same
		    shape as d.

	/**
		Find all points within distance r of point(s) x.
		
		Parameters
		----------
		x : array_like, shape tuple + (self.m,)
		    The point or points to search for neighbors of.
		r : positive float
		    The radius of points to return.
		p : float, optional
		    Which Minkowski p-norm to use.  Should be in the range [1, inf].
		eps : nonnegative float, optional
		    Approximate search. Branches of the tree are not explored if their
		    nearest points are further than ``r / (1 + eps)``, and branches are
		    added in bulk if their furthest points are nearer than
		    ``r * (1 + eps)``.
		
		Returns
		-------
		results : list or array of lists
		    If `x` is a single point, returns a list of the indices of the
		    neighbors of `x`. If `x` is an array of points, returns an object
		    array of shape tuple containing lists of neighbors.
		
		Notes
		-----
		If you have many points whose neighbors you want to find, you may save
		substantial amounts of time by putting them in a KDTree and using
		query_ball_tree.
		
		Examples
		--------
		>>> from scipy import spatial
		>>> x, y = np.mgrid[0:5, 0:5]
		>>> points = np.c_[x.ravel(), y.ravel()]
		>>> tree = spatial.KDTree(points)
		>>> tree.query_ball_point([2, 0], 1)
		[5, 10, 11, 15]
		
		Query multiple points and plot the results:
		
		>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
		>>> points = np.asarray(points)
		>>> plt.plot(points[:,0], points[:,1], '.')
		>>> for results in tree.query_ball_point(([2, 0], [3, 3]), 1):
		...     nearby_points = points[results]
		...     plt.plot(nearby_points[:,0], nearby_points[:,1], 'o')
		>>> plt.margins(0.1, 0.1)
